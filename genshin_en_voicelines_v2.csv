0,Tighnari,Hello,"Hi there. I'm Tighnari, Forest Watcher of the Avidya Forest. My duty is to preserve both the rainforest's ecosystem and the safety of its visitors. If this is your first time here, I suggest you first peruse the Avidya Forest Survival Guide, paying particular attention to the chapter ""Distinguishing Between Edible and Poisonous Mushrooms.""",,,Sumeru
1,Tighnari,Chat: Leaf Bookmark,"If you press a leaf between dry sheets of paper, you can make an attractive and handy bookmark.",,,Sumeru
2,Tighnari,Chat: Mistakes,Don't be afraid to make mistakes. It's all part of the learning process.,,,Sumeru
3,Tighnari,Chat: The Value of Knowledge,The value of knowledge cannot simply be quantified in monetary terms.,,,Sumeru
4,Tighnari,When It Rains,"I'm used to the rain, but you should probably use an umbrella.",,,Sumeru
5,Tighnari,After the Rain,I applied a plant-based waterproofing oil to my tail. One swish and it's dry.,,,Sumeru
6,Tighnari,When Thunder Strikes,"Ah, the thunder's so loud! Ugh... My head hurts...",,,Sumeru
7,Tighnari,When It Snows,"I don't see weather like this very often! Oh, are you cold? If you want, you can tuck your hands into my tail.",,,Sumeru
8,Tighnari,When the Wind Is Blowing,My ears... My ears... They're going to be blown inside out!,,,Sumeru
9,Tighnari,In the Desert,"Gah, it's so hot... Even a Mist Flower would melt in this heat... Ah, now that I think about it, it wouldn't... but you get what I mean, hehe... Ugh...",,,Sumeru
10,Tighnari,Good Morning,"Shh, listen! That's the sound of dew dripping upon the leaves.",,,Sumeru
11,Tighnari,Good Afternoon,"During lunch breaks, I like to sit in a tree and admire the sunlight streaming through the canopy. If I'm not careful, I'll fall asleep... Hehe.",,,Sumeru
12,Tighnari,Good Evening,Good evening. I'm preparing to go observe bioluminescent flora. Want to come?,,,Sumeru
13,Tighnari,Good Night,Get some sleep. I'll be on guard duty — it'll be a good time to write today's patrol log entry.,,,Sumeru
14,Tighnari,About Tighnari: Profession,"I studied botany in the Amurta Darshan. My academic adviser wanted me to join the faculty after graduation, but to be quite honest, I prefer a somewhat freer research environment. From my observations, the way that the Akademiya handles certain matters leaves much to be desired. Fortunately, my adviser didn't push the issue — heh, not like that would've worked.",,,Sumeru
15,Tighnari,About Tighnari: Kin,"Many people think that my kind are loners, and I don't blame them for thinking that. The few of us around are mostly scholars, and we're always chasing our research — so you'd be lucky to spy a single tuft of tail fur in a whole year. Like my father, for example. He's an entomologist, and lately, he's been studying the evolution of beetles in the desert... I have no intention of joining him. I'm ashamed to admit that I don't tolerate the sun very well. Prolonged exposure turns my brain and body into mush.",,,Sumeru
16,Tighnari,About Us: Getting Along,I believe that the best way to achieve mutual understanding with someone is to spend time with them. Other methods are less realistic. That's why there is no need to rush introductions. Time will settle everything.,,,Sumeru
17,Tighnari,About Us: Friends,"""Are we officially friends?"" What, so this sort of thing needs official documentation now? Okay then... Well, hand over your ""friendship certificate."" I assume it'll need my signature.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Sumeru
18,Tighnari,About the Vision,"I remember praying as a kid that if I were lucky enough to receive a Vision, it had to be a Dendro one. It wasn't because of research. I just wanted to make a vine ladder to reach high-hanging fruit.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Sumeru
19,Tighnari,Something to Share: Aranara,"I've heard about the Aranara for some time now, but I haven't personally seen any. Sometimes, I hear rustling sounds from the forest's depths, but they disappear when I go closer. That's a good thing, though. At least they know how to protect themselves, unlike those stupid adventurers whose first thought when they run into an Avidya Leopard is ""Ooh, maybe I'll form an inter-species friendship today.""",,,Sumeru
20,Tighnari,Something to Share: Karkata,"Don't worry about Karkata. I told the Matra I know that it's my research assistant. If anyone wants to do anything to it, they'll need to go through me. ...Since you seem to care a lot about Karkata, why don't you enroll in some courses at the Spantamad Darshan? That way, you can care for it even if I'm gone.",Friendship Lv. 4; The Unanswerable Problems,,Sumeru
21,Tighnari,Interesting Things,"Did you know that plants can camouflage themselves? Some mimic insects or birds to intimidate their natural predators, others produce bait to attract pollinators, and still others are obligate carnivores that utilize enticing fragrances or honey to lure in their prey... Hmm, I feel like I'm not just talking about plants anymore.",,,Sumeru
22,Tighnari,About Collei,"When that child was first brought here, she was effectively illiterate. It wasn't a huge issue, though. She's a hard worker and a diligent student, so she's made good progress. Still, her goal is to learn advanced medical techniques, so she still has a long way to go. She sometimes puts too much pressure on herself... Help her out when you can, would you? Consider it a favor for me as her mentor. Thanks a lot.",Friendship Lv. 4,Collei,Sumeru
23,Tighnari,About Cyno: General Mahamatra,"You want to see Cyno...? Well, firstly, a word of caution: if he ever comes chasing you down for work-related reasons, prepare for the nightmare of a lifetime. Other than that, General Mahamatra is a high-ranking position, so it usually isn't easy to find him. But he does occasionally go to Gandharva Ville to see Collei. As much as he might want to stay unnoticed, he can't fool my ears.",Friendship Lv. 4,Cyno,Sumeru
24,Tighnari,About Cyno: Good Question,"After my adviser's rescue, I wrote him a letter to send my regards. To my surprise, he wrote back saying that someone had already given him my regards in person. He ended the letter with a question ""The General Mahamatra said he hopes that the sages will enjoy 'a more tasteful reputation' thanks to the efforts of our Darshan. Whatever do you suppose he meant by 'a more tasteful reputation'?"" ...It's a good question. I'd like to know, too.","Friendship Lv. 4; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",Cyno,Sumeru
25,Tighnari,About Alhaitham,"Be careful of Alhaitham. I'm not saying he's a bad guy, but he purely operates by rationality, so people often find his actions unacceptable. If you don't believe me, just ask his roommate — thanks to Alhaitham, he has more pent-up frustration than an angry Anemo Slime.",Friendship Lv. 4,Alhaitham,Sumeru
26,Tighnari,About Kaveh,"Kaveh is a famous architect in Sumeru. The Palace of Alcazarzaray is his magnum opus. During the initial planning, he even asked me to recommend suitable ornamental flora. I don't know why or how, but he ended up heavily in debt after the palace was completed. Alhaitham is helping out by letting him stay at his place, but... I don't know whether that's a blessing or a curse...",Friendship Lv. 4,Kaveh,Sumeru
27,Tighnari,About Dori,"The renowned Lord Sangemah Bay is none other than Dori. I became acquainted with her through a previous research project. It had required very rare materials, and the only way I could get them was through her and her mysterious supply network. Uh... never you mind what I was buying and what I was researching, thank you very much!",Friendship Lv. 4,Dori,Sumeru
28,Tighnari,About Layla,"I've heard of her, the famous ""Sleepwalking Eccentric."" The rumors about her sleepwalking are really quite absurd: feats of superhuman strength, sprinting through Aaru Village at night, scaling the Wall of Samiel with her bare hands... Some even say that she can write a 100,000-word thesis while asleep! What a load of nonsense.","Friendship Lv. 4; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",Layla,Sumeru
29,Tighnari,About Lisa,"Cyno has mentioned her before — an extraordinary genius with a veritable wealth of knowledge and talent. A pity that she returned to Mondstadt so long ago. Perhaps, in the course of her study, she witnessed the horrifying side of knowledge...",Friendship Lv. 4,Lisa,Sumeru
30,Tighnari,About Lesser Lord Kusanali,"As a student, I once heard this saying: ""Plants and the Land of Dendro share the same history."" It could just be one of those things that people say, but I've always felt that there's a deeper meaning to those words... If I meet Lesser Lord Kusanali one day, I wonder if she would explain them to me?",Friendship Lv. 4,Nahida,Sumeru
31,Tighnari,About Dehya,"Everything happened so fast, and I didn't get the chance to properly thank her. To have a capable and reliable person like her on your side is extremely fortunate. I'm sure she must have many groups trying to persuade her to join their ranks. But she definitely doesn't strike me as the kind of person who would be interested in joining the Akademiya or the Forest Rangers, so I'll spare myself the inevitable rejection.","Friendship Lv. 4; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",Dehya,Sumeru
32,Tighnari,About Faruzan,Madam Faruzan possesses an extensive wealth of knowledge. I often invite her to inspect the mechanisms in the rainforest. The next time she's in Gandharva Ville... *sigh* I hope she doesn't sneak Collei more food. Nutrition is like medicine: moderation is key.,Friendship Lv. 4,Faruzan,Sumeru
33,Tighnari,More About Tighnari: I,"Are you acclimating to the rainforest? I suggest that you keep your eyes and ears open. Take care of yourself, and if anything happens, just flag down a Forest Ranger.",,,Sumeru
34,Tighnari,More About Tighnari: II,"*sigh* Sometimes I really do envy those simpletons who go around touching and eating anything and everything. In their minds, it must feel like miracles happen every day.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Sumeru
35,Tighnari,More About Tighnari: III,"To better serve the Avidya Forest, I occasionally offer training courses to the Forest Rangers. If you want to split hairs, then yes, these courses would be considered as ""dissemination of information"" by the Akademiya. But what are they gonna do — lock me up? I dare them. We'll see how many patients suffering from weird and wonderful ailments start flooding into the Bimarstan every day!",Friendship Lv. 4,,Sumeru
36,Tighnari,More About Tighnari: IV,"I'll let you in on a secret: I actually really like the atmosphere in the Grand Bazaar. Business is booming, everyone's so lively, and the theater is full of song and dance. Unfortunately, my ears don't tolerate loud sounds very well... Huh? You'll cover my ears for me? ...It'd be way too hard to walk like that! Thanks for the thought, though.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Sumeru
37,Tighnari,More About Tighnari: V,"I had many beautiful and fantastical dreams as a child, but they vanished from my memory one day after I grew up. Do you still have dreams? Tell me about them.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Sumeru
38,Tighnari,Tighnari's Hobbies,"Leaves and flowers often drop onto the ground of the Avidya Forest, sometimes perfectly intact. Leaving them on the ground would be such a pity... I can't help but pick them up and keep them as biological specimens. They can be used as educational materials for Forest Rangers or as decorative pieces. Very versatile.",,,Sumeru
39,Tighnari,Tighnari's Troubles,"Troubles? Let me think... Pollution in the Avidya Forest, adventurers who constantly stir up trouble, and rescue dogs that always want to mess with my tail... But these problems all have solutions. If you're talking about bigger concerns, then I really don't have any. In this regard, the life of a Forest Watcher is pretty simple.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Sumeru
40,Tighnari,Favorite Food,"This may sound strange, but although the blood of a carnivore runs through my veins, mushrooms are the one food that I can't give up. There are many species of edible mushrooms. Whether fresh or dried, they all give off a unique scent. Even when stewed with meat, it's the mushrooms' aroma that comes out on top.",,,Sumeru
41,Tighnari,Least Favorite Food,"My olfactory system is overly sensitive, so I lack the good fortune to enjoy heavily spiced foods... Quite the shame in Sumeru.",,,Sumeru
42,Tighnari,Receiving a Gift: I,Excellent ingredients and impeccable seasoning. In short — it's delicious.,,,Sumeru
43,Tighnari,Receiving a Gift: II,Nice flavor pairing. Could you give me a copy of the recipe? I want to put this on the menu for the Forest Rangers' next meal.,,,Sumeru
44,Tighnari,Receiving a Gift: III,...Do I need to teach you some new recipes?,,,Sumeru
45,Tighnari,Birthday,"Happy birthday! I picked out a potted plant in full bloom for you, along with a gardening guide. If anything happens to it, don't hesitate to find me at any time. This plant comes with a Forest Watcher lifetime guarantee.I'll have you know a lot of flowers are in season on your birthday. It took me forever to choose one. I'll get you a different species next year!",,,Sumeru
46,Tighnari,Feelings About Ascension: Intro,Germinating seeds break through the soil and take root.,Ascension Phase 1,,Sumeru
47,Tighnari,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up,"Seedlings grow, reaching out with their branches and leaves.",Ascension Phase 2,,Sumeru
48,Tighnari,Feelings About Ascension: Climax,Branches dotted with flower buds herald the advent of spring.,Ascension Phase 3,,Sumeru
49,Tighnari,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,A rich harvest that will lead to even richer ones.,Ascension Phase 4,,Sumeru

82,Chevreuse,Hello,"I'm Chevreuse, Captain of Fontaine's Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. You'll excuse me if I skip the pleasantries. Is there a case that needs my attention?",,,Fontaine
83,Chevreuse,Chat: Musket,The musket is my favorite weapon. It's both powerful and threatening... sometimes the latter trait is far more useful.,,,Fontaine
84,Chevreuse,Chat: Patrol,The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol isn't involved in regular patrol duties around Fontaine. The people we're after aren't exactly the type who just pop up on the street.,,,Fontaine
85,Chevreuse,Chat: Food,"""Feast-O's"" are just the best snack. They're easy to carry with you, and go with so many sauces... Gonna go buy some. Be right back.",,,Fontaine
86,Chevreuse,When It Rains,Don't worry. My musket can still fire in the rain.,,,Fontaine
87,Chevreuse,When Thunder Strikes,"Some criminals try to use the sound of thunder to conceal gun shots. But, that trick doesn't fool my ears.",,,Fontaine
88,Chevreuse,When It Snows,...Hold! I need to service my musket before the mechanism freezes.,,,Fontaine
89,Chevreuse,When the Sun Is Out,What nice weather! Especially good for keeping an eye on things.,,,Fontaine
90,Chevreuse,When the Wind Is Blowing,"With this wind, I'm afraid even my bullets might get blown off their mark.",,,Fontaine
91,Chevreuse,In the Desert,The sheer vastness of the desert is perfect for keeping certain things buried and out of sight.,,,Fontaine
92,Chevreuse,Good Morning,Good morning! I was just about to do a few rounds of strength training. Do you want to join?,,,Fontaine
93,Chevreuse,Good Afternoon,Afternoon! Do you want to grab some food with me at the Special Patrol's mess hall? The food there really fills the stomach.,,,Fontaine
94,Chevreuse,Good Evening,"Another day of work over, and without any huge disasters to boot. Let's grab a midnight snack. I'll lead the way.",,,Fontaine
95,Chevreuse,Good Night,Good night. I'm also going to turn in soon. ...I really hope nothing too serious happens while I'm asleep.,,,Fontaine
96,Chevreuse,About Chevreuse: Special Security and Surveillance Patrol,"The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol deals with a whole host of heinous crimes and dangerous criminals. As such, the methods we employ to enforce the law can be a bit on the... harsher side.",,,Fontaine
97,Chevreuse,About Chevreuse: Uniform Cap,"There's an unwritten rule in the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol. Any time a member dies in the line of duty, we hold onto their cap. Should a child of a deceased member ever join the Special Patrol, we then pass the cap down to them... I suppose you could call it a way of passing on a member's legacy.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
98,Chevreuse,About Us: Interests,"In my free time, I like to read crime novels. They differ from murder mysteries in that they focus less on describing the complicated details of the crime itself and more on the emotional and human conflicts surrounding the case. I find them very interesting.",As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,,Fontaine
99,Chevreuse,About Us: The Law,You can come to me at any time if you have questions about the law. Actually... You should come to me the minute you have the slightest inkling that something may not be legal.I can't tell you how many idiots I encounter every year who overstep simply because they fail to check where the line is drawn. I don't want to see you become like them.,Friendship Lv. 6; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,,Fontaine
100,Chevreuse,About the Vision,"My Vision is certainly an integral part of the way I execute my duties. For instance, my Musket has never had a major malfunction since I received my Vision.I'd say a captain who wields a musket and a Vision is more than enough to scare off a few cowardly criminals.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
101,Chevreuse,Something to Share,"Harcourt really did it, he arrested Mylis... even though she was his true love. I have to admire him for that, although... did Mylis really do anything wrong? All she did was find some jewelry and sell it off. I guess it didn't belong to her, but it's hardly the heinous crime that the aristocrats made it out to be... *sigh* It's hard to know what justice should look like sometimes, isn't it?",,,Fontaine
102,Chevreuse,Interesting Things: Gardemek,"Although our organization belongs to the Maison Gardiennage, the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol makes little use of Gardemeks. As for the reason... Well, let's just say those cumbersome machines would only get in the way of our bullets.",,,Fontaine
103,Chevreuse,About Navia,"I've heard about the murder case involving Navia's father. It caused quite the stir in the Maison Gardiennage at the time. It was the source of many disagreements, I believe.Fortunately, the truth has come to light and the true culprit has been held accountable... Justice may not always be swift, but it always prevails in the end.",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,Navia,Fontaine
104,Chevreuse,About Lyney,"Lyney is quite the famous magician. We once had a case where we arrested a magician suspected of deliberate harm, fraudulent behavior, and murder, but we could never figure out his methods. In the end, we brought on Lyney as a consultant. He helped us find a crucial piece of evidence that led to the successful conviction of the suspect. I heard that an author actually used that case as the basis for their mystery novel about a magician who used their craft to commit crimes.Unfortunately... the author ended up going a little overboard on the graphic detail, and since the crime is still fresh in everyone's minds, it'll be a while before they're able to get it published.",Friendship Lv. 4,Lyney,Fontaine
105,Chevreuse,About Freminet,"I once saw Freminet in a shop when we both reached for the same gadget. It was the last one available, but just as I was about to tell him he could have it, he withdrew his hand and ran out of the store. It might sound odd, but he fled like the Gardes were after him.",Friendship Lv. 4,Freminet,Fontaine
106,Chevreuse,About Clorinde,"Clorinde has built quite the reputation for herself in Fontaine as a Champion Duelist. Our positions are different, so I'm not at liberty to make any comments about her work. But I trust that she takes on those duels out of her own sense of justice.",Friendship Lv. 4,Clorinde,Fontaine
107,Chevreuse,About Wriothesley,The work Wriothesley does is highly effective. As least all criminals know that the Fortress of Meropide isn't the type of place you want to stay at long enough to grow old. That fact comes in handy during our interrogation work.,Friendship Lv. 4,Wriothesley,Fontaine
108,Chevreuse,About Emilie,"Emilie is a good friend. Her expert knowledge of chemistry has been a great help to me many times when analyzing evidence or tracking down a killer. She helps us discover information that no one else can see, like what type of perfume a suspect wore or what type of flowers they sent as a gift. She can even determine the places they've been right down to the very dirt they've stepped in... Plus, she's never been wrong.",Friendship Lv. 4,Emilie,Fontaine
109,Chevreuse,About Chiori,"Chiori's method of resolving disputes is bit radical. But, she has quite the network at her disposal and has provided the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol with intelligence on more than one occasion. In return, I turn a blind eye whenever she throws someone out the door or runs a malignant competitor out of business. If you look into it, you'll find that Chiori is always in the right. She's just not the type to waste her breath on explanations.",Friendship Lv. 4,Chiori,Fontaine
110,Chevreuse,About Charlotte,"Charlotte is the type of reporter that really gives you a headache. Whenever there's a major case, she's always one of the first people in the vicinity no matter how hard we try to secure the scene. One time, she was even detained as a suspect for half a month, but she was still able to finish her article while in custody... I really do need to find the time to have a formal conversation with her editor about her behavior.",Friendship Lv. 4,Charlotte,Fontaine
111,Chevreuse,About Sigewinne,"The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol has a long-lasting friendship with the Melusines. We often collaborate with the Melusines who work in the Marechaussee Phantom. They're kind, honest, and reliable. When it comes to handling major cases, the role they play is irreplaceable. I, myself, am quite close to several Melusines, Sigewinne included.Melusines have long been one of our most indispensable partners. If there continue to be those who dare to slander and belittle their name, then they'll find themselves looking down the barrels of our muskets.",Friendship Lv. 4; The Remains of the Past Day,Sigewinne,Fontaine
112,Chevreuse,About Neuvillette,"Everyone knows that the Iudex abstains himself of all personal emotion when presiding over a trial. Some even say he lacks the warmth of human emotion. But the way I see it, justice should remain uncorrupted by personal feelings. Those who break the law bear guilt. It's as simple as that.",Friendship Lv. 4,Neuvillette,Fontaine
113,Chevreuse,About Furina,"Lady Furina once ordered us to carry out some sort of... ceremonial musketeer performance. She not only wanted each of us outfitted with special ""ceremonial muskets,"" but she wanted us to practice all sorts of specialized drill formations as well. Luckily, in the end, she couldn't find the right song to pair with the performance and the matter was dropped entirely.",Friendship Lv. 4,Furina,Fontaine
114,Chevreuse,More About Chevreuse: I,"Sorry, I'm not great at talking to people... Well, talking to people outside of an interrogation room that is. If there's anything you want to know, please just ask.",,,Fontaine
115,Chevreuse,More About Chevreuse: II,"The Special Security and Surveillance Patrol is just one of the many branches of the Maison Gardiennage. We have a more daring way of doing things, and some in the Maison Gardiennage are under the impression that we don't exactly play by the rules.But， [sic]I don't think the way the Special Patrol operates should be influenced by outside forces. The criminals we face aren't your everyday goody-goodies from the Palais Mermonia. When crimes are committed swiftly and without warning, like the sudden downpour of a rainstorm, we have to be able to respond just as fast.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Fontaine
116,Chevreuse,More About Chevreuse: III,"The criminals I encounter aren't all cold-blooded killers and heartless villains.Most of them start off by making a small mistake but are too afraid to own up to it. In their efforts to make up for it in secret, they end up getting sucked into a whirlpool of lies. Before they know it, they're in over their heads, and they're forced down the path of a criminal despite the best of intentions.There's this line by my favorite playwright that goes, ""Lies are the soil in which the seeds of crime are sown.""But, he was arrested for plagiarism a few years later. Talk about dramatic irony, I suppose...",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
117,Chevreuse,More About Chevreuse: IV,"After my father was imprisoned, I was labeled ""a crook's daughter."" Growing up in Fleuve Cendre, I saw first-hand how many corners of Fontaine remain shrouded in shadow. Though my upbringing didn't garner me many friends, the knowledge I acquired was far more precious.Those who enforce the law must have their own conception of justice, one that they use to govern their actions. That is what my father taught me.And it has proved itself to be true many times over.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Fontaine
118,Chevreuse,More About Chevreuse: V,"To be honest, as the Captain of the Special Security and Surveillance Patrol, I've witnessed evil beyond measure. Too many times, I've seen good, innocent people get hurt or even lose their lives after getting caught up in events beyond their control... I can't help but feel angry and powerless whenever I think about them.I firmly believe that criminals must be punished, but we must not let punishment trap us in an endless cycle of vengeance.If we are blinded by our emotions and let them control our actions, we run the risk of drowning in them.Those who hold more power should be especially cognizant of that fact. We must all search for our own sense of justice, but we must also be wary of losing ourselves in the pursuit of it.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
119,Chevreuse,Chevreuse's Hobbies,"Perhaps training? Or target practice? If I really had to say, though, it would be reading crime novels. That reminds me, I should grab the latest copy of ""The Murder Files.""",,,Fontaine
120,Chevreuse,Chevreuse's Troubles,I really hate wasting time learning frivolous pieces of etiquette. My time is better spent keeping criminals in check.,,,Fontaine
121,Chevreuse,Favorite Food,"I love anything full of grease and sugar. Food like that provides me with ample energy during the workday... Plus, it's a real mood booster. But, on my days off... those fat-inducing foods become my worst enemy. That being said, absolving the world of their existence also comes with its own pleasures.",,,Fontaine
122,Chevreuse,Least Favorite Food,"I... can't really handle eating raw food. If I'm going to eat it, then it has to be fully cooked.",,,Fontaine
123,Chevreuse,Receiving a Gift: I,It's delicious. *sigh* But it seems I've already had a few bites too many... I'll have to work it off with extra training.,,,Fontaine
124,Chevreuse,Receiving a Gift: II,"Hm, much better than what we get in the Special Patrol's mess hall.",,,Fontaine
125,Chevreuse,Receiving a Gift: III,It's filling but doesn't leave you wanting more... An excellent dish in my book.,,,Fontaine
126,Chevreuse,Birthday,"Happy Birthday! Ahem... At attention! Chin up, shoulders back! Let's take your measurements... I want to commission a smaller, more portable musket and holster for you...Okay, at ease. While the musket is being commissioned, you need to log some hours at the shooting range first. No time like the present! Follow me!",,,Fontaine
127,Chevreuse,Feelings About Ascension: Intro,Not bad. I feel my aim getting steadier by the minute.,Ascension Phase 1,,Fontaine

130,Chevreuse,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"Thanks for all your help. I can't promise that the full force of the Special Patrol will be at your beck and call, but as for myself, you need only say the word and I'll be there.",Ascension Phase 6,,Fontaine
131,Neuvillette,Hello,"Greetings. I am the Chief Justice, or ""Iudex"" of Fontaine, but you may simply address me by using my surname, ""Neuvillette."" Not because I wish to keep my distance from you... No, I am merely conscious that being overly familiar may bring the impartiality of the judiciary into question in some people's eyes.If you have any requests or concerns, then — to the extent permissible by law, at least — we can sit down and discuss them together as we partake of some imported water from Qiaoying Village.",,,Fontaine
132,Neuvillette,Chat: Trials,"I see the value in my own work, but I also see the meaning in all the endeavors of the people of Fontaine. I believe I will continue to take pride in fulfilling my duties.",,,Fontaine
133,Neuvillette,Chat: Water Tasting,"Water comes in many flavors to the discerning palate. Mondstadt's water is crisp and pure, while water from Liyue has an enduring aftertaste. In Inazuma, the water possesses a depth of flavor unlike any other. Sumeru's water, meanwhile, has a rich and complex flavor profile, but it must be savored patiently to fully appreciate it.",,,Fontaine
134,Neuvillette,Chat: Melusines,"Melusines are beautiful creatures. They are the pride of Fontaine. Be sure to befriend them, and cause them no harm.",,,Fontaine
135,Neuvillette,When It Rains,"Ah, my apologies. This heavy rain must be quite an inconvenience for you.",,,Fontaine

138,Neuvillette,When It Snows,"Snow is in fact one of water's natural self-cleansing mechanisms. But human activity tends to reduce snow's purity, so do not consume it.",,,Fontaine
139,Neuvillette,When the Sun Is Out,"I find that the, um... beauty of bright sunlight is best appreciated from the indoors through a window.",,,Fontaine
140,Neuvillette,In the Desert,I cannot help but feel that you bringing me here is some sort of an assassination attempt...,,,Fontaine

143,Neuvillette,Good Evening,Good evening. I hope you have not encountered any unpleasantness today.,,,Fontaine
144,Neuvillette,Good Night,"Good night. I am quite fond of the image of a perfectly still body of water, and it is on this note that I would like to wish you a peaceful, undisturbed sleep. May no waves of emotional distress ripple through your dreams tonight.",,,Fontaine
145,Neuvillette,About Neuvillette: Trials,"I am no rabid fan of trials. I preside over them only out of duty, for this is the task that has been entrusted to me.",,,Fontaine
146,Neuvillette,About Neuvillette: The Weeping Hydro Dragon,"So you have heard of that local legend as well? *sigh* Who told you about that? Or more pertinently, who was responsible for spreading it in the first place... Well, never mind. I don't think that the Hydro Dragon would ""weep,"" per se. I think he just finds himself a little stirred when he gets a taste of the tears that have been shed on this land, on account of all the emotions they contain.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
147,Neuvillette,About Neuvillette: The Meaning of Trials,"This is a topic that's been discussed ad nauseum... I don't mean to condescend to humanity, but it is quite clear to me that society's concepts of justice, fairness, equality, and rule of law are not equivalent, and can never be. Now of course, water always seeks its own level, and it was in this spirit that the previous Hydro Archon, Egeria, hoped to achieve universal equality by connecting all things with love. Her successor chose instead to seek equality by means of the law. But ultimately, due to various external factors, this unfortunately manifested itself in the distorted form of trials for the sake of trials. Nevertheless, there are reasons for everything. I should refrain from criticizing her.",Masquerade of the Guilty,,Fontaine
148,Neuvillette,About Us: Witness,"Since you hail from beyond the stars, I invite you to be my witness as I judge this upended world. ""This realm dismantled was of the Formidable Father himself, but what now reigns here is a cluster of filthy feathers. Though we live in a world of disarray, I shall undertake to restore all that has been broken.""",Masquerade of the Guilty,,Fontaine
149,Neuvillette,About Us: The Human World,"The time that I have spent living among the citizens of Fontaine, and traveling with you, has transformed my views. Besides this, I pardoned the sins of humanity long ago, so I can promise you that my future judgments will not cause any harm to the common folk. Nevertheless, my grievances with the usurpers have yet to be settled... They owe a debt of blood that shall not be forgotten.",Friendship Lv. 6; Masquerade of the Guilty,,Fontaine
150,Neuvillette,About the Vision: I,"I was once advised to wear a counterfeit Vision, so that I might more easily intervene during moments of crisis. To be quite frank, I was not enamored by this suggestion, nor the implication that one must only exercise the power that is rightfully theirs under false pretenses. With that said, however, I have developed a newfound appreciation for the value of human yearning and determination having spent considerable time around Vision-bearing humans.",Friendship Lv. 4; Cataclysm's Quickening,,Fontaine
151,Neuvillette,About the Vision: II,Excuse me? You're saying even some members of The Seven don a counterfeit Vision before mingling with their people? Ha... My apologies — I was just caught off guard by the absurdity of the situation.,Friendship Lv. 4; Cataclysm's Quickening,,Fontaine
152,Neuvillette,Something to Share: Laws,"Fontaine does have some rather intriguing laws on its books. For instance, ""it is forbidden to release any flying objects during the first three days of each month,"" ""during the dry season, all bivalves that wash ashore belong to the Hydro Archon, while other mollusks belong to the people,"" ""no domestic pets shall be named after Furina,"" ""tomato ketchup is to be consumed in restaurants only as a condiment, never on its own,"" and, finally, ""Melusines are to be addressed using she/her pronouns, never the impersonal it/its""... That last one was my personal contribution.",,,Fontaine
153,Neuvillette,Something to Share: Rainy Days,"Some days, my mind wanders, and I fantasize about walking into the rain... *sigh* Ah, but don't worry, my flights of fancy don't distract me from my work.",,,Fontaine
154,Neuvillette,Interesting Things: Vishaps,"The Vishaps' ancestry can be traced directly back to the Fontemer, which is why they are so adept at evolution. I am reminded of an old custom that the dragons once observed: We would take a sip of our perished young brethren's blood. Whenever the tides are disrupted by the motion of the moon and stars, the water within the bodies of us Hydro organisms surges up towards our heads, reminding us that our deceased kin will soon be revived.",Cataclysm's Quickening,,Fontaine
155,Neuvillette,Interesting Things: Humans,"From my observations, humans have a tendency to view themselves as being in opposition with nature. And whenever this point is raised, someone is always quick to respond by declaring that humans are in fact a part of nature, like any other organism. To someone like me, however, who knows an inkling of the truth, what would be most beneficial is if human civilization and the natural world of this planet could seek ways to co-exist with one another.",,,Fontaine
156,Neuvillette,About the Geo Archon,"Nothing will stop me from rendering judgment on each of The Seven. As the Archon who won the Authority of Geo, Deus Auri must be called to trial. If one does not wish to see us on opposite sides of a conflict, they need not worry, for I intend to stay in Fontaine for the foreseeable future, which could well mean another four hundred years. As another point of consolation, even when the trial eventually takes place, it is still not a given that the judgment will lead to a physical confrontation.",Friendship Lv. 6; Masquerade of the Guilty,Zhongli,Fontaine
157,Neuvillette,About the Anemo Archon,"I shall fulfill my vow to judge all of The Seven in turn, even if the sky should fall and the ground give way. As the recipient of the Authority of Anemo, the God of Breeze and Hope must also stand trial. ...Hmm? He spends most of his time being a harmless drunkard, you say? Well, even so, I must meet him for myself and proceed from there.",Friendship Lv. 6; Masquerade of the Guilty,Venti,Fontaine
158,Neuvillette,About the Electro Archon,"As a survivor of the dragon race who has regained my full dragonhood, I must fulfill my oath and obligations even if it means returning all the water in the oceans back to the heavens. In taking the Authority of Electro, the Narukami placed herself on the list of the usurpers. Oh, so she has isolated herself in the Plane of Euthymia, and now rarely appears in public? Then I shall pay her a visit in another few centuries.",Friendship Lv. 6; Masquerade of the Guilty,Raiden Shogun,Fontaine
159,Neuvillette,About the Dendro Archon,"Though the day will come when I put her on trial, I must commend the God of Verdure on her sense of responsibility. Few things are without flaws in this world, but the devotion and benevolence she displays are a testament to her commitment to continued progress. I felt enormous regret when I learned of the mistreatment she has endured over the past five hundred years.",Friendship Lv. 6; Masquerade of the Guilty,Nahida,Fontaine
160,Neuvillette,About Wriothesley,"Wriothesley is a trustworthy man. I fought hard for the title and reputation he now has. I expect you to think that I've simply been duped by his flattery and appearance of loyalty... But to that, I would quote the Inazuman proverb: ""The words unspoken are the flower."" Which means, some things are best left unsaid.",Friendship Lv. 4,Wriothesley,Fontaine
161,Neuvillette,About Clorinde,"Clorinde's peerless skills have made her the most powerful Champion Duelist in our nation. As a successor to the Marechaussee Hunters of old, she plays a vital role in ensuring the fairness and impartiality of the courtroom. Also, she's actually not as stoic as she might appear.",Friendship Lv. 4,Clorinde,Fontaine
162,Neuvillette,About Lyney and Lynette,"Their performances are just fascinating, don't you think? They draw you into a magical world where, on one hand, everything that takes place is part of an elaborate deception — but on the other, all manner of miracles are possible if you are only willing to believe.",Friendship Lv. 4,Lynette; Lyney,Fontaine
163,Neuvillette,About Sigewinne,"I don't know how Sigewinne is faring these days. But if I hear so much as the whiff of a rumor that she's being bullied, I shall summon Wriothesley here and demand an explanation. She's so kind and vulnerable... She brought me some Kamera film the last time she visited, and asked to listen to more of my commentary on the water of Natlan... How long is it until her next vacation?",Friendship Lv. 4,Sigewinne,Fontaine
164,Neuvillette,About Furina,"Now, the curtain has finally fallen on her ""performance""... The character she portrayed was an imaginary one, yet in playing that role she fulfilled her duties... Though she is meek and full of doubt by nature, she was able to use madness to stiffen her resolve and see her duty through to its conclusion. The work that she has done over the centuries is truly immense. If she were to ever make a return to the stage, I should personally attend the performance and give her my heartfelt applause... Yes, I must do so when the opportunity arises.",Friendship Lv. 4; Masquerade of the Guilty,Furina,Fontaine
165,Neuvillette,About Navia,"I regret to say that after my various interactions with her — such as when I inadvertently angered her, and when I accepted her apology — and even now, in spite of the guilt I continue to feel over what happened to her father, I feel... very distant from her, as if I'm observing the starry sky from the bottom of a deep lake. It is by no means intentional, and I also know it is not something that I can easily make up for. Unlike water, emotion does not settle quickly once agitated, nor is it naturally inclined towards equilibrium.",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,Navia,Fontaine
166,Neuvillette,More About Neuvillette: I,"I usually do my best to avoid forming personal relationships, or even collaborating with others outside of established procedures. But you have shown yourself to be trustworthy, and you have no problematic entanglements with Fontaine's local factions. Therefore, I would be pleased to journey with you.",,,Fontaine
167,Neuvillette,More About Neuvillette: II,"This is something that I can only say in private — I could never publicly share my views on this matter: It positively baffles me that Fonta has managed to become such a popular drink. Though, I suppose its appeal to humans is not beyond comprehension. One can both rehydrate and replenish blood sugar in one gulp, and at an exceptionally cheap price.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Fontaine
168,Neuvillette,More About Neuvillette: III,"I went to see an opera recently. It was about a lady whose personal charm and manipulative schemes allowed her to continue to dominate the affairs of the grand mansion where she lived even after her death, like a ghost that refused to be exorcised. The acting was impeccable, and the story exceptional. It also reminded me of the current state of affairs in the real world.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
169,Neuvillette,More About Neuvillette: IV,"For a number of reasons, I rarely leave Fontaine. As a result, though I enjoy tasting spring water from all over the world, I always have it delivered to me here, rather than collecting it myself. And yes, subtle as the flavor differences between samples of different regions may be, I am perfectly capable of distinguishing between them. Do you still doubt me? I am the Iudex. I do not lie.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Fontaine
170,Neuvillette,More About Neuvillette: V,"I have to say, my daily life is not without its inconveniences. For instance, I often find myself stepping on my robes as I sit down, or squashing my coiffure against the chair. And if I lean my head too far back, sometimes my hair even gets caught in the ornamentation. Nevertheless, I must wear these garments to maintain the dignity of a Chief Justice, and endure whatever inconveniences this entails. Incidentally, the world at large appears to operate on this general principle, too. Everyone is faced with an identity that they must accept, endure, understand, and eventually learn to co-exist with. This has been my experience all along.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
171,Neuvillette,Neuvillette's Hobbies,"Water tasting is a rather sophisticated discipline. Pyro-heated water has the standard ""au naturel"" flavor found ubiquitously in the natural world, while water boiled using charcoal has distinctly rustic notes. Similarly, while Cryo-chilled water is cold but otherwise unremarkable, the frozen rivers of Snezhnaya, when melted, produce a water with an entirely different flavor profile altogether.",,,Fontaine
172,Neuvillette,Neuvillette's Troubles,People seem to respond to the sight of a man in the rain without an umbrella as if it were some sort of strange spectacle.,Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
173,Neuvillette,Favorite Food,"Animals can survive for weeks without food, but merely a few days without water. There is no dish that could ever compare to pure, unadulterated water. With that in mind, food items that contain plenty of liquid are the next best thing.",,,Fontaine
174,Neuvillette,Least Favorite Food,"How can people bring themselves to consume deep-fried foods? Or grilled food with no sauce? The worst culprits in my view are those Charcoal-Baked Ajilenakh Cakes. Surely, even eating a dehumidifying agent would be kinder on the stomach?",,,Fontaine
175,Neuvillette,Receiving a Gift: I,"Delicious. An abundance of juices, and the ingredients have been cooked to perfection.",,,Fontaine

236,Lyney,Hello,"This is no mere illusion, tis I, Lyney! The greatest magician in all Teyvat! How are we feeling today? Excited? Surprised? Oh, you're curious how I appeared in front of you like this? Well... Hmm, your eyes are like topaz, precious, pure, and lovely. I like them! I've decided — I'm going to put on a show just for you. Watch carefully now. Blink, and you might miss it!",,,Fontaine
237,Lyney,Chat: Distraction,"This is no time for distractions! Seriously, you have a great magician standing right here... You don't want to miss the best part, do you!?",,,Fontaine

246,Lyney,Good Afternoon,"I'm going to check out some products used for magic tricks later this afternoon. Perhaps they'll spark some inspiration for some new tricks. Want to come along?

247,Lyney,Good Evening,Good evening. The Great Magician Lyney will be performing later tonight... but I'm sure you didn't need me to tell you that!,,,Fontaine

249,Lyney,About Lyney: Sweet Talker,I should probably emphasize again that I'm rarely so open with anyone — I guess it's because you're not just anyone.,,,Fontaine
250,Lyney,About Lyney: Partnership,"*sigh* I'm afraid I'd find myself going into standby mode without Lynette by my side.

251,Lyney,About Us: Withholding the Truth,"Wow, you're not beating around the bush! ...Let me put it this way — delicious berries must often grow in areas thick with thorns, otherwise they would be devoured by greedy foxes. This is what we call self-defense! I mean, sure, I don't mind telling some small lies to others at times, but between the two of us, I've never done anything worse than omitting a minor detail here and there, right?",,,Fontaine
252,Lyney,About Us: Principles,"Magicians generally do not reveal the core secrets behind their tricks, but if you don't mind becoming my apprentice and calling me ""Master Lyney,"" then that would be different.

253,Lyney,About the Vision,"If a magician were to go onstage with their Vision in hand, people might suspect the authenticity of their tricks, so I habitually take it off before performing.

254,Lyney,Something to Share,"Magic isn't just a performance art, it's also a way of thinking. Many things in this world seem simple at first glance but play host to all sorts of secrets if you look deeper.",,,Fontaine
255,Lyney,Interesting Things,"Cats can use their ears to express their feelings. If they flatten them backwards, it indicates fear or caution, and if their ears are perked up and occasionally face forward, that usually means they're happy.

258,Lyney,About Lynette: Modes,"You think my sister doesn't talk much? Oh, she's probably just not in the right mode. Next time, start by saying ""Activate Chat Mode"" to her. If you're lucky, she might have a great deal of things to say to you. Hmm, and if you're not lucky...? Well, she'll just stare for a while, but hey, at least you'll get to see a different side of her!",Friendship Lv. 4,Lynette,Fontaine
259,Lyney,About Lynette: Twins,"My sister and I have always been inseparable. There's no hardship we can't overcome as long as we're together, and similarly, we share all our joys with each other.

And if I find out anything at all that might help you, I'll be sure to let you know.",Friendship Lv. 4,Lynette,Fontaine
260,Lyney,About Freminet,"My naive little brother still believes in fairy tales. I envy him, really. Uh, just to be clear though, he didn't actually tell me that.

261,Lyney,About Neuvillette,"Monsieur Neuvillette rarely appears in public, almost as if he's intentionally trying to put some distance between himself and the people.

262,Lyney,About Furina,"The Hydro Archon, Lady Furina, is very unpredictable, and her manner of speech can be quite provocative, almost as if she sees talking itself like some sort of performance. The people of Fontaine have a particular soft spot for excitement and drama, which is why many hold her in high esteem.",Friendship Lv. 4,Furina,Fontaine
263,Lyney,About Chiori,"Flattery won't get you anywhere with her. She'll only give those who can truly appreciate her art a second look. How does she see me, you ask? Come on now, that hurts!

264,Lyney,About Navia,"I didn't think that she'd be willing to help strangers like us. If it hadn't been for all of you, Lynette and I wouldn't have been acquitted... Thank you so much.

265,Lyney,About Charlotte,"Charlotte has been trying to get me to agree to an interview ever since we met... Ugh, it feels like she's already asked twenty times now. She has a good nose for finding news, and she's the persistent type, too.

266,Lyney,About Clorinde,"Clorinde's quite famous as a Champion Duelist. But from what I've read in the papers, she seems to have gotten into a bit of a pickle.

269,Lyney,More About Lyney: II,"Of course, there's no way to ensure that you'll never slip up when performing magic tricks. The way I see it, the point is not to perform perfectly, but to stay calm at all times and adapt as needed. Even if some small flaws occur, you just need to make the audience believe that it's all part of the show, and you'll still deliver an entertaining and unforgettable performance!",Friendship Lv. 3,,Fontaine
270,Lyney,More About Lyney: III,"As orphans without parents to shelter us, Lynette and I were forced to roam the streets since childhood, so we've been through a lot.

271,Lyney,More About Lyney: IV,"Haha, so even now you still don't completely trust me, huh? You're a vigilant one — not that that's a bad thing. I'll never need to worry about you getting duped by someone else. But on the other hand, since you've taken it upon yourself to watch my every move, you'd better be careful when you blink... Who knows, I might just tell a huge, terrible lie while you're not paying attention! You'd be in a real pickle then, wouldn't you?",Friendship Lv. 5,,Fontaine
272,Lyney,More About Lyney: V,"Actually, the real me is nowhere near as outgoing or chatty as I appear. More often than not, I only work my verbal ""magic"" as a means of getting closer to people.

273,Lyney,Lyney's Hobbies,"Hey, what do we have here? Ah, a cute, little white rabbit — you like it? Curious about when it got here? You should be! Hehe, the look of amazement on our audience's face is what we magicians love the most.",,,Fontaine

275,Lyney,Lyney's Troubles: Doves,"In the past, I would let the doves I raised fly freely, and they would always return to me.

Maybe this fun little performance could earn me one of your very own fish dishes?",,,Fontaine
277,Lyney,Least Favorite Food,"Our performances require that Lynette and I have matching physiques, so we have to avoid eating any oily food. Now, that's not a huge problem for me, but it can be tough for my sister — the fried fish they sell on the streets smells amazing, after all...",,,Fontaine

302,Klee,Something to Share,"At the Knights of Favonius building, you're not allowed to blow up the walls.

394,Xianyun,About Xianyun: Disciples,"One has always been a staunch defier of convention and expectation, preferring instead the freedom to live life precisely how one pleases.

397,Xianyun,About Us: Bonds,"Despite one's lack of interest in worldly attachments, one is quite conscious indeed of the importance of ""bonds."" Such a simple word for a thing so profound that it all but defies articulation... Take oneself and those old fossils, for example.

398,Xianyun,About the Vision,"Rex Lapis once said that a Vision is a call to duty — to act as a guardian, watching over humankind, and that whether we choose to withdraw into the mountains or embrace the clamor of the city, we must never shirk that duty.

399,Xianyun,Something to Share,"That mechanical bird of mine is only a prototype. One had aspirations for a much larger model, hollow inside so that it could unfurl into a vehicle with which to embark on sight-seeing journeys with one's old friends... The challenges of powering and operating such a device, however, proved somewhat insurmountable. After all, it required pitch control, the ability to change form, not to mention the safety features... *sigh* If only Guizhong were still here. She, no doubt, would offer many baffling but ingenious solutions to this conundrum.",,,Liyue
400,Xianyun,Interesting Things,"Mt. Aocang is an ideal place for spiritual cultivation. It possesses natural beauty beyond compare, and the pure, unalloyed essence of nature flows strong all around.

401,Xianyun,About Ganyu,"One once asked Ganyu what she typically works on during her overtime hours.

402,Xianyun,About Shenhe,"Shenhe told me that once, when she was delivering an order for Wanmin Restaurant, she ran across the rooftops to save time. Her customer was terrified when she jumped down onto their doorstep, and was about to call for the Millelith... Fortunately, Shenhe disappeared as quickly as she arrived, leaving the food delivery behind and making haste before the customer had time to react.

403,Xianyun,About Zhongli,"When Rex Lapis first heard of one's plan to take up residence in Liyue Harbor, he recited a long and detailed list of considerations for the furnishing and adornment of a home.

Perhaps one could make some tofu pudding for you to pass on to him.",Friendship Lv. 4,Xiao,Liyue
405,Xianyun,About Hu Tao,"That young lady says the most bizarre-sounding things, yet she appears to be rather highly regarded by the staff of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor — even Rex Lapis himself saw fit to serve under her in some sort of ""consultancy"" capacity...

406,Xianyun,About Xiangling,"One happened to mention the Supreme Cuisine Machine in conversation with Xiangling once, but one was rather taken aback when she responded by saying that a dish is inauthentic unless it is prepared by hand...

409,Xianyun,About Yun Jin,"There are many Liyue operas adapted from stories about the adepti, including some based on one's own life and exploits... One has never watched those, of course — what could be more embarrassing than watching someone else play oneself on the stage?

411,Xianyun,About Gaming,"One is very fond of Gaming. He is good-hearted and entertaining in conversation, but never grandiloquent. We first met when one was resting by a lake, and he very kindly shared some of his provisions with me.

Hehe, this wise elder will be sure to look out for him after that.",Friendship Lv. 4,Gaming,Liyue
412,Xianyun,More About Xianyun: I,"You wish to know more about one's past? ...One doubts there would be much worth sharing — it's all ancient history by now.

Are there any of them as amenable to conversation as oneself? Let us brew some tea, and then you can tell me all about it.",,,Liyue
413,Xianyun,More About Xianyun: II,"There was a time when many mortals longed to seek the guidance of the adepti. One knows not how they discovered the location of one's abode, but every other day or so, one would find people leaving offerings of food at the altar on Mt. Aocang... Hmph, why ever would mortals expect an adeptus to interrupt their meditation for the sake of ingesting a mortal meal? Most bemusing. Nevertheless, since their actions were heartfelt, one saw only fit to indulge in— Ahem, to embrace their offerings once they had departed.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Liyue
414,Xianyun,More About Xianyun: III,"Then there were those who came right to one's doorstep, requesting to be taken on as disciples. One refused to grant them an audience, but they simply would not leave, and before long, Mt. Aocang had become something of a pilgrims' campsite... One promptly posted a sign outside the abode, decreeing that all would-be disciples must first present ninety-nine dishes over a period of as many days, each dish unique in its recipe and featuring the Qingxin as the main ingredient... Naturally, the crowd soon dispersed. Hmph, to master the adepti arts and the mechanical arts requires supreme talent and the utmost stillness of mind. Training would be a futile endeavor for those who cannot even persevere for a mere three months.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
415,Xianyun,More About Xianyun: IV,"For all the wondrous feats that can be accomplished by one who has mastered the mechanical arts, one often uses it for purely recreational purposes. There was one year when it snowed heavily in Liyue, and Mt. Aocang was covered in several feet of snow. Seeing everyone cooped up in their abodes with nothing to do, one created a Snowdrift Mechanism for skiing on the mountains. One was having a tremendous time of it along with Guizhong and Streetward Rambler... until, of course, Moon Carver noticed as much and decided to join in. Moments later, he had managed to send the mechanism flying off the rails and plummeted deep into a snow bank. It took us hours to dig him out... Later, one introduced a great many safety features to the mechanism, to the point where it could be safely piloted by even a three-year-old child. Although this did entail a compromise on the top speed of the vehicle.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Liyue
416,Xianyun,More About Xianyun: V,"One has read a great many works of popular literature since moving to Liyue Harbor. Those of the chivalric martial arts genre have proven the most entertaining, although the heroes within their pages are all works of the imagination. Would it not be even more compelling to tell the stories of the many such real-life figures with whom one is acquainted? It is a pity that one's disciples are so averse to one sharing the tales of their lives with other people... Perhaps you could relay more of the tales from your travels? One could adapt those into a novel instead.",Friendship Lv. 6; A Thousand Moonlit Miles,,Liyue

She understands the unwritten rules of human society, she knows what's in people's hearts... Master once told me that even the adepti aren't able to achieve this. I hold her and her work in high regard.",Friendship Lv. 4,Ningguang,Liyue
449,Shenhe,About Beidou,"I find I don't need to worry about etiquette with her, and unlike with some people, I don't need to rely on non-verbal cues to discern the true meaning of what she's saying. That makes me a lot more comfortable. The only problem is... Well, there are too many people around her all the time, and I heard there's also many crew members on her ship... I need you to go with me. It's the only way I can cope with so many people.",Friendship Lv. 4,Beidou,Liyue
450,Shenhe,About Yun Jin,"Yun Jin performs... It's called ""Liyue opera,"" isn't it? I like this particular type of social interaction. You can get to know about the other person's background without having to actually interact with them one on one. If she ever includes your story in one of her performances, I'm sure the result will end up being quite incredible. I'm looking forward to it.",Friendship Lv. 4,Yun Jin,Liyue
451,Shenhe,About Ganyu,"I've heard many stories about her from my master. She's really quite different from how I originally imagined her... But don't worry, I'll be keeping this to myself. Speaking of Ganyu, her work in Liyue Harbor is unbelievably busy... It seems that there is a price to pay for those who want to integrate into the mortal world.",Friendship Lv. 4,Ganyu,Liyue
452,Shenhe,About Chongyun,"It's hard for me to believe that... I still have living relatives in this world. If he has any difficulties with his training, I am more than willing to help enlighten him. However, he will need to meet me alone in the mountains. Their family is too... sociable. I wouldn't know how to turn down their invitations without being impolite.",Friendship Lv. 4,Chongyun,Liyue
453,Shenhe,About Xingqiu,"I've seen him lean over to you and whisper things in your ear. If he dares threaten you, I will make sure he... Hmm? You mean it's just an in-joke between friends? Genuinely...?",Friendship Lv. 4,Xingqiu,Liyue
454,Shenhe,About Zhongli,"That gentleman claims to be a mortal, yet is very familiar with my master, who is an adeptus. Master once said: ""If you see him drinking on a stone stool in front of my abode, do not disturb him. Let him sit quietly for a while."" And that's precisely what I did.",Friendship Lv. 4,Zhongli,Liyue
455,Shenhe,About Baizhu,"The quality of his medicinal herbs is as good as it gets, he is also easy-going and considerate of others. By comparison, the little snake on his neck has no filter at all... Haha, don't worry, I didn't lift a finger against it, I won't go as far as getting into a quarrel with a snake.",Friendship Lv. 4,Baizhu,Liyue
456,Shenhe,About Hu Tao,"I often see her wandering in the woods singing strange songs. Actually, I must have heard all of her songs several times each by now. I'm used to her singing, but I still find it strange. That being said, I don't hate it either.",Friendship Lv. 4,Hu Tao,Liyue
457,Shenhe,About Xiao,"My first impression of him was that he's not one to smile. After meeting him again more recently, however, he's still as reserved as ever, but... he seems a lot more relaxed now. Maybe he... met someone special.",Friendship Lv. 4; A New Star Approaches,Xiao,Liyue
458,Shenhe,About Xianyun,"The last time Master and Shuyu came to dine at Wanmin Restaurant, I noticed that Shuyu seemed to have adopted a number of Master's mannerisms. It gave me pause for thought... I grew up under Master's care, too. Is it possible that I have subconsciously picked up a thing or two from her as well...?",Friendship Lv. 4; A Thousand Moonlit Miles,Xianyun,Liyue
459,Shenhe,More About Shenhe: I,"Please don't pay any heed to the way most people refer to me. I am not an adeptus, and don't possess any divine abilities. I was born in a branch family of a clan of exorcists, and grew up in the mountains far away from Liyue Harbor. I am but an adeptus's disciple, nothing more, nothing less.",,,Liyue
460,Shenhe,More About Shenhe: II,"When faced with delinquents who are just out to cause trouble, most people will try to reason with them. This course of action perplexes me. Removing the root of the problem and disposing of these ill-intentioned fools seems like the obvious course of action. Why do common folks prefer the labor-intensive route?",Friendship Lv. 3,,Liyue
461,Shenhe,More About Shenhe: III,"I am the apprentice of multiple adepti and have trained alongside them. After a certain point, however, they stopped teaching me new techniques and started focusing on how to control my intense homicidal urges. Oh, don't be nervous... Yes, craters have been left in the ground, and giant trees have been uprooted. But these things only ever happen in the mountains, far away from civilization, and certainly have never affected innocent lives. Besides, I can control myself now.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
462,Shenhe,More About Shenhe: IV,"My father's intent was to trade my flesh and blood for my mother's life. After he abandoned me in that cave, I still held out hope that he'd come back to rescue me. One day went by. Then two days, three days... I used every ounce of energy in my body to fight off that monster. But as I collapsed on the ground, I finally realized that the day I was waiting for would never come. To this day, I don't which one it is... Was I abandoned because I'm cursed, or is it the way I've been treated in life that has cursed me?",Friendship Lv. 5; The Crane Returns on the Wind,,Liyue
463,Shenhe,More About Shenhe: V,"Once, I secretly left the mountain and returned to my childhood village without telling my master. But it was deserted, and my father had long since passed away. I suddenly realized that the bond between my relatives and I had been completely severed. And nothing that I'd ever cared about in the past could ever have a future. Ever since then, I have abandoned everything related to the mortal world... That is, until I met you.",Friendship Lv. 6; The Crane Returns on the Wind,,Liyue
464,Shenhe,Shenhe's Hobbies,"The most important aspect of meditation is stillness. Let go of all agitation, and let the air around you flow into your body. This technique allows me to quickly focus in on myself. I heard from my master that after meditating beyond a certain point, there is no need to adopt the meditation posture anymore. Adepti can meditate even when standing up... I still have much more to improve on.",,,Liyue
465,Shenhe,Shenhe's Troubles,"The fear of losing the people most important to me, and the desire to save them... This kind of feeling makes my heart ache, I've never experienced anything like it before. It's a burden, yes, but it's also... something to hold onto.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Liyue
466,Shenhe,Favorite Food,"I've sampled numerous dishes during my time away from the mountains, but the truth is that I don't really remember how they taste. The only dish I can never forget the flavor of is that bowl of noodles I ate at home, so long ago... I shouldn't have to remember that. Why do I have to remember that?",,,Liyue
467,Shenhe,Least Favorite Food,"Chew medicinal herbs for long enough, and you can only taste the bitterness... In all the years I trained under the adepti, I had to abstain from all kinds of things, and to a point, I got used to it. But them... ""The common delights of the mortal realm pose no hindrance to the adepti, thus, we may indulge in all manner of dishes as we please""... These are the exact words my master said.",,,Liyue
468,Shenhe,Receiving a Gift: I,"Mmm, this taste... Is it really meant for me?",,,Liyue
469,Shenhe,Receiving a Gift: II,The food you cook is indisputably delicious. I can't refuse it.,,,Liyue
470,Shenhe,Receiving a Gift: III,"No matter. I'm used to this kind of flavor, after all.",,,Liyue
471,Shenhe,Birthday,"I've been told that birthdays are important occasions for most people. They give presents to celebrate the anniversary of the other person's birth. Material possessions aren't really my thing, but... The view of the starry night sky in the mountains is the most beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life. I've frozen this lake and turned it into a mirror, so you can appreciate the reflection of the fleeting clouds and distant stars right up close. This is my way of celebrating your birthday... Hope you like it.",,,Liyue
472,Shenhe,Feelings About Ascension: Intro,The power I harness... It grows stronger.,Ascension Phase 1,,Liyue
473,Shenhe,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up,"If my master were to learn about this, she'd probably have me add some more red ropes...",Ascension Phase 2,,Liyue
474,Shenhe,Feelings About Ascension: Climax,"I haven't been training as single-mindedly lately, and yet it's as if I'm growing stronger and stronger without making a conscious effort... I'm left to assume the only way for me to achieve this is by your side.",Ascension Phase 4,,Liyue
475,Shenhe,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"I once believed that freeing my mind from all agitation was the only way to overcome. But after everything I've experienced recently, I finally understand... Only when the right things weigh on your mind can the desire to protect awaken inside of you. And that turns your power into something... meaningful.",Ascension Phase 6,,Liyue
476,Thoma,Hello,"It's good to meet you at last, Traveler. I've been hearing about you for a long time now. I'm your new buddy, Thoma — as long as that's okay with you, of course!",,,Inazuma

485,Thoma,Good Afternoon,"On the lunch menu today, we have Sakura Tempura and Tricolor Dango! Here, there's some for you, some for Paimon, and I also put some aside for milady and the man of the clan himself. Ah, wait, I forgot someone... There's none for me...",,,Inazuma
486,Thoma,Good Evening,"Come quick, we gotta get down to the market — they slash the prices on fish around this time of day. Oh, and if you find something that you just can't do without, I'll help you haggle the price down.",,,Inazuma
487,Thoma,Good Night,"Okay, good night. You had a busy day today, you should get some rest, too. Don't stay up late.",,,Inazuma
488,Thoma,About Thoma: Housekeeper,"It was never Ayaka or Ayato's intention to make me the housekeeper, I volunteered. I like this kind of work. Putting everything in order gives me a great sense of achievement, and based on everyone's reactions... Yeah, I think I do a pretty good job.",,,Inazuma
489,Thoma,About Thoma: Meaning,"For me, housework is about keeping a space clean and tidy, so that everyone who lives there has a smile on their face. And now... it looks like I'm responsible for another smile. I'll do my best to deliver!",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
490,Thoma,About Us: Eating Alone,"Hey, how come you're eating here all alone? ...Uh, is it okay if I join you? Or did you just want some space?",,,Inazuma
491,Thoma,About Us: Oath,"If you hadn't put yourself out there during the Vision Hunt Ceremony and taken on the Raiden Shogun all by yourself, I would've lost my Vision, and with it all my aspirations. I've been thinking about this a lot, and it seems there's only one way I could ever properly repay you...I, Thoma, give to you my weapon and my loyalty, and I promise to fight for you, no matter what.","Friendship Lv. 6; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",,Inazuma
492,Thoma,About the Vision,Those that receive Visions should look after them. I certainly don't plan on losing mine.,Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
493,Thoma,Something to Share,"I've gotten to know all kinds of people over the years, and I'd say that Inazumans are more particular about etiquette than Mondstadters. If you make sure you're always polite to people, it's much easier to get things done.",,,Inazuma
494,Thoma,Interesting Things: Tanuki,"I've always wanted to see a tanuki shapeshifting. They say it can change into all kinds of things, and that it likes to play pranks on passersby. It's a creature with a sense of humor, that's for sure.",,,Inazuma
495,Thoma,Interesting Things: Animals,"Are you an animal person, too? If you are, let me take you to the outskirts some time, it's great. I just need to give a whistle, and all these puppies and kittens will come out of nowhere and start strutting around your ankles, clamoring for your affection. Haha, just imagining it is already brightening my day.",,,Inazuma
496,Thoma,About Yae Miko,"Lady Miko? Wh—What about her? *sigh* Every time Miss Kamisato sends me out to deliver messages, my least-favorite destination is the Grand Narukami Shrine... Oh! N—Not because Lady Miko scares the bejeebers out of me, it's, uh... respect. Yes! She strikes respect deep into my heart, ahahahaha...",Friendship Lv. 4,Yae Miko,Inazuma
497,Thoma,About the Raiden Shogun: Comparison,"In my homeland of Mondstadt, almost everyone has great reverence for the Anemo Archon, Barbatos. But people in Inazuma feel a little differently toward the Shogun. How can I put this... They feel love, respect, gratitude... but also fear.",Friendship Lv. 4,Raiden Shogun,Inazuma
498,Thoma,About the Raiden Shogun: The Unknown,"Honestly, I don't harbor any resentment toward the Shogun. Yes, she almost took my Vision away, but ultimately that's just because of her unique perspective. Everyone has their own perspective, there's nothing strange about that.The only thing I don't understand is her goal in doing so. What does she imagine eternity really looks like for Inazuma? And why is sacrificing her people's aspirations so necessary to achieve it? I can neither understand nor agree with her approach.","Friendship Lv. 4; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",Raiden Shogun,Inazuma
499,Thoma,About Beidou,"The captain of The Crux — a formidable woman indeed. She once promised to take me out onto the open ocean to get a look at the thunderstorm that seals off Inazuma from the outside world. It's a shame that to this day, I've never had the chance to take her up on the offer...","Friendship Lv. 4; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",Beidou,Inazuma
500,Thoma,About Kamisato Ayato,"As head of the Kamisato Clan, he's in a tough position. With all the political upheaval, he has to contend with public disquiet on one hand and a bunch of self-serving, degenerate public officials on the other. It's best not to dwell on it. All I can do is make sure to look out for him when he's at home.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kamisato Ayato,Inazuma
501,Thoma,About Kamisato Ayaka,"Milady is in all respects a well-rounded person: erudite, compassionate, well-mannered, and elegant... The one thing she could do better is to speak her mind more. In fact, watch out for this the next time you're talking to her — sometimes, she looks like she's about to say something, but then she holds back. If that happens, keep asking her opinion, see if you can encourage her to open up a little.","Friendship Lv. 4; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",Kamisato Ayaka,Inazuma
502,Thoma,About Yoimiya,"Of Naganohara Fireworks fame? She's so easy to get along with. Super straightforward, just says whatever she thinks.

503,Thoma,About Sayu,"Ah Sayu, stubborn Sayu. I've asked her countless times to teach me ninjutsu, but she always refuses. She even goes out of her way to avoid me now... I'm just a student looking for a teacher, am I really that out of line?",Friendship Lv. 4,Sayu,Inazuma
504,Thoma,About Kujou Sara,"The Tenryou Commission General... Mm... Make sure to be extra careful if you have any dealings with her. She has a lot of power in her hands, and she's not very open to persuasion. Smiling and batting your eyelids certainly won't get you anywhere with her.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kujou Sara,Inazuma
505,Thoma,About Arataki Itto,"Hmm... Word on the street is that he's quite a character — apparently, he even has youkai heritage. Have you met him? If you two are close, maybe you could introduce me sometime. It's good to make friends from all walks of life... youkai included!",Friendship Lv. 4,Arataki Itto,Inazuma
506,Thoma,About Shikanoin Heizou,"Ho, that guy is a detective for the Tenryou Commission. He seems to have his own way of doing things — not the easiest person to get along with. Also... Any situation that involves a detective is probably not one that's going to end well. I think I'll keep on giving him a wide berth.",Friendship Lv. 4,Shikanoin Heizou,Inazuma
507,Thoma,About Jean,"Oh, so Jean from the Gunnhildr Clan is the Master of the Knights of Favonius now? She definitely deserves it, she's known all over for her impeccable conduct...

508,Thoma,About Eula,"You've had a run-in with Eula Lawrence before, huh? All I know is that their whole family are about the worst-tempered people you could ever meet.

509,Thoma,More About Thoma: I,"Anything I can lend a hand with? If something needs doing around the house or you're having some interpersonal strife, just say the word. Hmm? A conversation... I see, I see. That's a little different from what I'm used to, but I'm all for it.",,,Inazuma
510,Thoma,More About Thoma: II,"I'm not from Inazuma originally — I think I've told you that before, right? I took a boat all the way here from Mondstadt, found I liked the place, and was also lucky enough to meet the wonderful Kamisato siblings, so I just ended up staying.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Inazuma
511,Thoma,More About Thoma: III,"I get homesick once in a while, too, so I completely relate to all the international merchants on Ritou. I try to look out for them as much as I can. The difference between us is that they see themselves as just passing by, and have no intention of trying to integrate here. And because that's how they think, it becomes their reality. The majority of Inazumans will never see them as anything more than outsiders.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
512,Thoma,More About Thoma: IV,"For some of the more conservatively minded people in Inazuma, the idea of an outlander working as a retainer for one of the Commissions is unthinkable. So there was a time when I was not that welcome here. I'm pretty sure I'd have been deported a long time ago without a couple of Kamisatos fighting my corner. I couldn't let the clan down after they'd been so kind to me, so I put in a lot of honest work, and eventually, everyone was finally able to accept me.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Inazuma
513,Thoma,More About Thoma: V,"I'm not sure if I should get into this, but... Ah, hopefully you won't mind. I went through a period where I really just wanted to go home — Mondstadt is my homeland, after all. But I was torn... It wouldn't be easy to leave Inazuma behind, either. I mean, just look how good the people here have been to me. The Kamisato Clan always has a room for me, and there are people I've met here that are like family. So, I went back and forth over it, and ultimately decided I'd stay in Inazuma. When I'm missing Mondstadt... I can just chat with you. You don't mind my rambling, do you?",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
514,Thoma,Thoma's Hobbies,"I've been really getting into stories about the unnatural recently. Especially ones about shapeshifting youkai — they're so fascinating.

516,Thoma,Favorite Food,"Without a doubt, my favorite food is Rice Cake Soup. I like cooking up a big, delicious potful for everyone to share. It's a recipe for a good time.",,,Inazuma
517,Thoma,Least Favorite Food,"As far as food is concerned, I'm fine with anything. If we're counting beverages, though... I'm not very good with alcohol. Don't laugh, and before you say it — yes, I've wondered what this says about my identity as a Mondstadter. But, y'know... too much alcohol is bad for you, anyway. So not drinking is a good thing.",,,Inazuma
518,Thoma,Receiving a Gift: I,Delicious! Could I get another bowl of rice?,,,Inazuma

562,Hu Tao,More About Hu Tao: III,"If you ask me, there's nothing hard or scary about working at Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, it's just a pain is all. It's a shame — others see us going out to work at night and just don't understand — and that's what scares them. *sigh* You all just don't understand!",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
563,Hu Tao,More About Hu Tao: IV,"I'm Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's 77th Funeral Director, my grandfather was the 75th. First thing I took over was funeral affairs. Haha, surprising huh? And just like that, it's already been a few years... Time really does go by so quickly.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Liyue
564,Hu Tao,More About Hu Tao: V,"Balance must be maintained, and yet destinies remain variable. Death has its own rules, and yet is still hard to predict. Remember — no matter where, no matter when, no matter what the reason — one should never poke fun at death.

577,Kirara,Hello,"I'm Kirara, a courier for Inazuma's Komaniya Express. Rest assured, there's no destination I can't deliver to! Huh? My tails? Oh, I have 'em because I'm a youkai — a nekomata, to be specific.",,,Inazuma

589,Kirara,Good Evening,"Good evening, I'm all ready to head out. Huh? What do you mean it's time for bed? Nighttime's when I'm the most alive! I can travel faster and see better, and there are fewer people on the road, too.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma

591,Kirara,About Kirara: Paw Pads,"My boots? Oh, they're my paws, actually. I can use my youkai powers to turn them into human feet, but I feel way more at ease walking with my claws and paw pads. Um, don't touch them, please! They're ticklish!",,,Inazuma
592,Kirara,About Kirara: Name,"Granny named me Kirara. Back when I still had only one tail, Granny would give me head pats and chin scratches and tell me how bright and pretty my eyes were.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
593,Kirara,About Us: Journey,"You travel far and wide, and I deliver packages all across the world. That makes us similar, don't you think? But although we both travel from one place to the next, my travel expenses are covered, while you have to pay for everything out of pocket... Huh? N—No! I didn't mean to brag!",,,Inazuma
594,Kirara,About Us: Encounters,"I've met all sorts of people through delivery work. Some have become regulars of Komaniya Express, while others have become my friends... and I feel so lucky for that. Each delivery ends with the package reaching its destination, but our bonds with each other live on. If you ask me, friendships between youkai and humans aren't all that difficult to form.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
595,Kirara,About the Vision,"I still remember the first time I tried shape-shifting into human form using my youkai powers, thrilled at the thought of finally being able to experience the human world for myself. And before I knew it, my Vision had appeared at my waist. Hmm... Did this god have a profound desire to travel to all sorts of places, too?",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
596,Kirara,Something to Share: Hunting,"Weapons forged by humans aren't bad at all, but I'd rather rely on my feline instincts sometimes. I mean, when there's a little finch right before your eyes, don't you just want to creep up from behind, crouch really low on the ground, wait for the right moment... then pounce right on it? Not even successful package deliveries can compare with the satisfaction I get from hunting down prey!",,,Inazuma
597,Kirara,Something to Share: Box,"Granny told me that this was my favorite box to sleep in when I was little. Hehe, it's kinda funny — back then, all I knew about Komaniya Express was that their boxes were big and comfy, and if you'd told me that one day, I'd make a living out of giving all their boxes away to other people, I'd have never believed you. Hehe, although it is definitely more of a squeeze trying to fit inside their boxes these days... What? What do you mean, all the stuff in there already...? Ugh, no, I mean their empty boxes! I'd never open a customer's parcel!",,,Inazuma
598,Kirara,Interesting Things: Tree Houses,"Did you know that some houses in Sumeru are built atop trees? Oh, it'd be so nice to bathe in sunlight all day without having to climb down for food. Huh? You already knew? Okay then... do you also happen to know how they're built? I have claws and all, and even so, I felt really exhausted climbing up one of those tall trees to deliver a package. How were the building materials and furniture delivered up there when the people of Sumeru didn't even have claws to begin with... I don't get it...",,,Inazuma
599,Kirara,Interesting Things: Big Houses,"I got to see lots of big houses while delivering packages, ones that were even bigger than Granny's house! Palace this, temple that... And there were countless smaller rooms in each of them. Wouldn't living in such a huge place make you feel a little empty inside, though? Having a place to eat in the morning, a place to sunbathe at noon, and a little box to rest in at night is more than enough for me. Huh. Does that mean big houses are just larger boxes for humans?",,,Inazuma
600,Kirara,About Yae Miko,"Lady Miko is a widely renowned kitsune youkai in Inazuma, so it's natural for young youkai like myself to approach her with reverence. But contrary to my expectations, she was surprisingly amiable. She even came to visit me in person and taught me lots of useful stuff about how to survive in human society! Things like proper human etiquette, ways to approach people, and different fried tofu recipes... Huh? That last one was just for her?",Friendship Lv. 4,Yae Miko,Inazuma
601,Kirara,About the Raiden Shogun,Parcels sent to Tenshukaku are all packaged intricately with multiple layers of wrapping. Maybe that's what they call a package fit for the Almighty Shogun. Some of them smell really good... I wonder what's inside.,Friendship Lv. 4,Raiden Shogun,Inazuma
602,Kirara,About Shikanoin Heizou,"I crossed paths with that detective a long while back. Once he learned that I was a nekomata, he started asking me to investigate the whereabouts of missing cats. I was happy to help at first, but then I'd hear the cats say things like ""I just want to see the outside world!"" or ""I get so bored when I'm at home,"" I felt bad for them. So I lied, telling him that I hadn't seen any cat at all. But it seemed like he could see right through me...",Friendship Lv. 4,Shikanoin Heizou,Inazuma
603,Kirara,About Kujou Sara,"I've always wanted to have a chat with the Lady Tengu. Maybe it's because she's the general of the Tenryou Commission, but I find her quite intimidating, so I've only ever watched her from afar. I—I'm just curious about her wings, you know? Are they ever an inconvenience? How does she deal with shedding feathers? Mm... Speaking of the feathers, I think lining my box with them would be super comfy.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kujou Sara,Inazuma
604,Kirara,About Arataki Itto,"He's an oni, but he gets along with humans perfectly — he even has his own gang! Oh, I'm so jealous. Maybe I should go ask him for some advice.",Friendship Lv. 4,Arataki Itto,Inazuma
605,Kirara,About Lyney,"So I met this magician in Fontaine who could make anything disappear, then make it reappear out of thin air! He must've used some kind of youkai power to make that happen, right? Hmm... Is he a youkai too, then?",Friendship Lv. 4,Lyney,Inazuma
606,Kirara,About Chiori,"She's really nice to me. I often ran into her in the past when she was out researching ways to make fabrics and develop color palettes. She was always worried that I'd leave claw marks all over her beautiful textiles, but come on, why would I do that to her? She's running a store in Fontaine now and sometimes asks me to deliver stuff to her. Hehe, she even helped me tailor the clothes I'm wearing now.",Friendship Lv. 4,Chiori,Inazuma
607,Kirara,More About Kirara: I,"Granny told me many stories when I was a little kitten. About the youkai of Inazuma, the festivals held in the city, the delicacies of other nations... I would curl up on her lap and listen until I fell asleep. Even now, I still can't tell which parts of the stories were real, and which were a part of my dreams...",,,Inazuma
608,Kirara,More About Kirara: II,"Being a courier is the perfect job for me. The Lady Kitsune told me that those who don't work can't fit into human society, and I'm not having any of that! That's why I've decided to take every delivery seriously. I—I'm not going back to the boonies, even if it means I get to be a Great Youkai or whatever!",Friendship Lv. 3,,Inazuma
609,Kirara,More About Kirara: III,"Maybe it's because I look like an easy target, but I often run into bandits when I'm on the road — but I always manage to chase them off! I don't go all out, though, because if the company was held liable for the injuries I caused... Well, I'd get canned!",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
610,Kirara,More About Kirara: IV,"Whenever I set foot in a new city, I always climb somewhere high up and gaze down at the scenery. Sometimes a breeze will pick up and the petals will float like Crystalflies from one end of the street to the other. And when the sun begins to set, I'll find a nice spot to watch the city lights come on. From high up above, they look like flickering specks of sunlight dancing beneath the forest shade at noon. I could stay up there all day if I wasn't in a hurry to deliver my packages... *sigh* I wish I could take Granny with me and show her all these things.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Inazuma
611,Kirara,More About Kirara: V,"It's really important to enjoy your life! In the last few days of a long-distance trip, or on a night when all my work’s [sic] done, I'll always have a hearty meal at the busiest restaurant, then look for the most comfortable rooftop and feel the breeze on my face until I fall sound asleep... There are so many little joys in the world that deserve to be savored, and it'd be such a great loss if I didn't relish every one of them. Which is why I always pick the bones clean when I'm eating fish!",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
612,Kirara,Kirara's Hobbies,"I like delivering packages across the world. Whenever I see an address I've never been to before, I get so excited that I can't sleep. I mean, I just wish that I could be there right this instant. I grew up surrounded by forests and shrubs, and it gets boring pretty quickly. But things are different out here. There are so many things I've never seen before, and it feels like there's something new waiting for me around every corner!",,,Inazuma
613,Kirara,Kirara's Troubles,"The life of a human may be full of surprises, but there are so many rules too. Humans can't sleep on a roof, catch fish from a pond, or find a nice place to scratch and sharpen their claws... But as soon as I revert to my original form, no one bats an eye over any of these things. The trouble is that my nekomata form attracts a lot of attention, so I can't just walk into a restaurant and order food the way a human would...",,,Inazuma
614,Kirara,Favorite Food,"When I was still a cat, I loved everything Granny made for me — I could gobble up an entire bowl in one go! As for now... Sashimi Platters are my go-to staple! With tender and fresh fish directly served on a plate, I don't even have to go through the hassle of removing the bones and scales! But the restaurant staff always gives me this strange look whenever I start working my way through the fish heads...",,,Inazuma
615,Kirara,Least Favorite Food,"Once, I was catching fish by the ocean when a crab caught me off guard and pinched my tails from behind. It hurt so bad, I thought they were gonna get snipped off! Ugh, why do people like eating crab anyway? They have so little meat, and their shells are so unbelievably thick — I can't even open them with my claws. Oh, and I can't stand anything hot either. I could hardly believe it when I learned there's a dish called ""Butter Crab."" How do humans manage to eat something so hard AND hot?",,,Inazuma
616,Kirara,Receiving a Gift: I,"Whoa, this is amazing! I've never tasted anything like this before! You... you wouldn't happen to be the great youkai of cooking or something, would you?",,,Inazuma

619,Kirara,Birthday,"Happy birthday! It doesn't matter if you're a human or a youkai, coming into this world is always worth celebrating! If you want, I can take you to the place I grew up in.

623,Kirara,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"Whoa... With this much power, I think even that kitsune youkai might need to watch out... Hehe, just kidding! It's not a competition, after all.

637,Kaveh,About Kaveh: Expertise,"It's fair to say I'm a pretty proud person when it comes to my area of expertise. Most scholars are when talking about their chosen fields. After all, we build our whole lives around it. I mean, if I ever stopped taking pride in my own work, then I would also forfeit the right to have any expectations of myself or anyone else.",,,Sumeru
638,Kaveh,About Kaveh: Artistry,"Aesthetic isn't the number one priority in my work, and nor should it be: Quality and safety are paramount. But I never neglect the artistic side either. That's what sets my work apart from others'.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Sumeru
639,Kaveh,About Us: Appreciation,"You must've seen the Palace of Alcazarzaray before? That's my magnum opus. I sacrificed so much for that... Everyone else thought I'd lost my mind.

640,Kaveh,About Us: Ideals,"I've always thought that you can never truly know a person until you understand their deepest wishes. But once you start exploring hopes and dreams, whether they're your own or someone else's... it can be a dangerous journey. You might unlock something that can't be put away again. Not everyone can face the potential consequences of that.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Sumeru

642,Kaveh,Something to Share,People who know what drives them to create deserve our respect. Wouldn't you agree?,,,Sumeru
643,Kaveh,Interesting Things,"The uninitiated often assume that the expertise of Kshahrewar architects starts with clay and ends with lumber. It's such an ignorant perspective that it's not even worth arguing against... If all it took to build a house was to smush a few random materials together, there'd be no need for this discipline in the first place... As well as being one of the building blocks of human culture and civilization, architecture is also an art form. Art does not exist in a vacuum, so I've always been mindful of the experiential factor for the occupants, and the emotional character conveyed to those looking on from the outside... Oh, and I'm always looking for better ways to integrate artistic expression and practical functionality.",,,Sumeru
644,Kaveh,About Lesser Lord Kusanali,"Lesser Lord Kusanali is a wise and capable god. Not only is she extremely knowledgeable, she also possesses virtue far beyond mortal comprehension. I have only the utmost respect for her tolerance of others — especially in a nation of learning like Sumeru, that takes great equanimity.Sometimes, though, I do stop to wonder... Surely even the gods must have their struggles, too? Oftentimes, confusion is the beginning of wisdom... In which case, how can we ever achieve true happiness?",Friendship Lv. 4,Nahida,Sumeru
645,Kaveh,About Alhaitham: Temperament,"I guarantee you'll never meet anyone else who's as infuriating as him! And for the record, yes, I would say that to his face. Sure, he's smart, and sure, geniuses often come with a bad temper, but that's only half the story with him... He knows perfectly well how to appear friendly and likable to others, he just doesn't want to.If he ever gives you the impression that he doesn't really have a temper, or that he's rigidly logical like a machine, then you just don't know him well enough yet. He definitely has a personality, it's just... too big a personality. Most people wouldn't get it.",Friendship Lv. 4,Alhaitham,Sumeru
646,Kaveh,About Alhaitham: It's Complicated,"Alhaitham helped me out a fair amount recently. If we were still as close as we were during our student days, then I'd be thanking him every chance I got. Now, though... I can't seem get a word of appreciation out of my mouth. Even if I could, I wouldn't want to give him the satisfaction.I guess you could say our relationship is something of a mixed bag these days? Honestly, with everything that's happened, it almost feels like the universe has been playing pranks on us... It's hard to make sense of it all... too much to process for one lifetime. I will say that it's not every day that you get to know someone like him — I just wish he could rein in some of the worst excesses of his personality. Okay, yeah, that's never gonna happen.",Friendship Lv. 4,Alhaitham,Sumeru
647,Kaveh,About Tighnari,"Ah, Tighnari... He's one of the nicest guys you could know. If you've met him, you'll know what I mean. He's kind, and he has enormous expertise in his field, but he never brags about it in front of other people. And he seems to genuinely care about his work.Back when I was building the Palace of Alcazarzaray, I asked him for some tips on how to pick out the right ornamental plants. After he wrote back to me, he also helped me out with some other issues, too. Oh, and I almost forgot — he was the one who first introduced me to Cyno.",Friendship Lv. 4,Tighnari,Sumeru
648,Kaveh,About Dori,"Dori is the owner of the Palace of Alcazarzaray... Excuse me? Mine? No, don't be ridiculous. I know full well that it doesn't belong to me... I know, I know, but... argh, please, let's not go there!Dori is a shrewd one. She knows how to coerce others into doing things for her. I, uh... For, ahem, various reasons, I now owe her a large sum of money. It all got quite complicated in the end, but... A—Anyway, I wish she'd show me a little mercy, and stop making my life a misery for the sake of Mora. I swear, she doesn't seem like a bad person at heart, so... I just don't understand, how did she turn out like this?",Friendship Lv. 4,Dori,Sumeru
649,Kaveh,About Cyno,"Cyno can come across as cold and ruthless, but he's actually a very big-hearted guy. I still remember how shocked I was when Tighnari said he was gonna introduce me to his best friend, and then a couple of seconds later, an incredibly intimidating matra comes walking through the door... I honestly never expected to meet a matra who's so comfortable hanging out with scholars. Gotta say though, I can't stand his sense of humor. It really makes my skin crawl. If he ever invites you to a meal at Tighnari's place, make sure someone's bringing beer, because no one should have to endure Cyno's humor while sober.",Friendship Lv. 4,Cyno,Sumeru
650,Kaveh,About Collei,"I've met Collei quite a few times now. As Tighnari's student and assistant, she follows him everywhere. With her diligence and patience, she's much more responsible than most other kids her age. But, umm... I can also tell that she's got a lot going on inside.",Friendship Lv. 4,Collei,Sumeru
651,Kaveh,About Nilou,"Nilou's talent as a dancer is indisputable. Zubayr Theater really lucked out when they recruited her. I've heard that she has a great personality too — she always smiles and says encouraging things to her audience when she's performing. Once I can find some time, I'll have to catch one of her shows.",Friendship Lv. 4,Nilou,Sumeru
652,Kaveh,About Faruzan,"Madam Faruzan doesn't mince her words, so I can understand why some students at the Akademiya are afraid of her. She doesn't have any bad intentions, though — all she wants is to devote herself completely to the research that interests her. Some people say that all Haravatat scholars are hard to get along with, and uh... heh, I'll let you be the judge of that.I assume she's already asked you to be her student? She sure is a little intense when she's doing the hard sell, huh... But she can walk the walk too. She really does know her stuff.",Friendship Lv. 4,Faruzan,Sumeru
653,Kaveh,More about [''sic''] Kaveh: I,"You heard that I've earned myself a little fame in Sumeru? Hahaha, don't believe everything you hear. They're exaggerating, trust me. It's easy enough to make a name for yourself in Sumeru if you stick around here long enough — honestly, I think managing to keep a low profile would be more of an achievement.I hope you didn't first hear about me because of my bankruptcy scandal, though. Hmph... If you're actually willing to hear me out, I could tell you about some of my more redeeming qualities, heh...",,,Sumeru
654,Kaveh,More about Kaveh: II,"You're not thinking about enrolling in the Akademiya, are you? ...Well, if you do sign up, from a pragmatic standpoint, I'd have to advise you to steer well clear of design. Don't get me wrong — it's a fascinating subject to study, but the work is... brutal. I spent some time working under one of my seniors after I first graduated, and they worked me to the bone every day... I was constantly being ordered around like a pack animal. I really don't know how I survived for as long as I did...",Friendship Lv. 3,,Sumeru
655,Kaveh,More about Kaveh: III,"While everyone's aesthetic preferences differ to a point, beauty is, on the whole, a pretty concrete concept.

If you ever need any advice on that front, by the way, you're always welcome to come to me.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Sumeru

688,Albedo,About Family,"Family? Although Alice has always asked me to call her mother.... when I think of the idea of ""family,"" my master comes to mind first.

690,Albedo,About Sucrose: Habits,"Working with Sucrose on alchemy research is quite pleasant, but she has some... stubborn qualities in regards to certain aspects unrelated to research.

701,Albedo,Albedo's Hobbies,"Hmm... Besides research, the activity I spend most of my time on is probably sketching.

704,Albedo,Least Favorite Food,"What food do I dislike? ...Large portions of meat at restaurants. I have a rather small appetite, so a meal like that only ends up in tragedy — either I overeat and the joy of the taste is lost, or I don't finish it and the food is wasted.

708,Albedo,Birthday,"Happy birthday. You look especially happy, would you mind if I sketched you? The capacity of our brains is limited, so we are bound to forget things.

Anyway, it was just that one time, I never saw her again after that.Now that I think about it, it's probably because the sight of me meditating motionless must be pretty boring to watch. Not exactly suspicious.",Friendship Lv. 4,Yelan,Liyue
931,Chongyun,More About Chongyun: I,"Discipline is everything. Unbridled passion can have disastrous consequences. Trust me, I would know. ...Oh, no no no, not from personal experience, of course. Haha... Uh... I'm just stating my observations from what I've seen in my travels around Liyue.",,,Liyue
932,Chongyun,More About Chongyun: II,"I was born with something called congenital positivity, meaning I have too much positive energy... Apparently it's so rare it only happens once every thousand generations or so. It means I repel all evil for miles around... *sigh* Actually, that's a bad thing. I must be the only exorcist in history who can't get within ten miles of an evil spirit.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Liyue
933,Chongyun,More About Chongyun: III,"One of the main symptoms of congenital positivity is excess passion, something which has gotten me into many embarrassing situations. In an effort to alleviate these symptoms, I have to abstain from eating chilis and all hot food. I also have to take a parasol with me everywhere, and I avoid listening to rousing music. I wonder, will I ever overcome my condition for good?",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
934,Chongyun,More About Chongyun: IV,"Waiting for evil to show up at the doorstep will get you nowhere — you have to go out and hunt it down. By purging Liyue of evil spirits, I bring peace of mind to people and also broaden my horizons. If an evil spirit ever bothers you, just let me know. I'll come and help you out right away.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Liyue
935,Chongyun,More About Chongyun: V,"To permanently banish the forces of evil from the world is my ultimate goal as an exorcist. If that grand day ever comes, I suppose I should be able to consider trying many new things, such as hot springs, Jueyun Chilis, and... partaking in other activities of a more passionate nature. Ugh, what am I doing... Ugh, I shouldn't be dwelling on these things, even thinking about them is too stimulating for me...",Friendship Lv. 6,,Liyue
936,Chongyun,Chongyun's Hobbies,I like listening to Tea Master Liu's stories. His narration really brings the hair-raising tales of the supernatural to life. Why not come with me some time?,,,Liyue
937,Chongyun,Chongyun's Troubles,"After making numerous inquiries and putting in an enormous amount of effort, I finally tracked down the location of an old haunted temple. So I camped out there for four whole days, ready to exorcise the hell out of that place... and nothing happened. Not even the faintest glimpse of an evil spirit. *sigh* Sadly, this is a regular occurrence for me.",,,Liyue
938,Chongyun,Favorite Food,"Nothing makes me happier than sitting down to an authentic Inazuman meal, ingredients imported of course. After training hard all day, the ice-cold freshness of Inazuman cuisine takes the exhaustion away.",,,Liyue
939,Chongyun,Least Favorite Food,Anything piping hot and laden with chilis is an absolute no-go for me. The mere thought of a Jueyun Chili gives me hot flashes.,,,Liyue
940,Chongyun,Receiving a Gift: I,Cold dishes are just to my liking! I'll save some for after my training.,,,Liyue
941,Chongyun,Receiving a Gift: II,"I'm sorry, I know you mean well, but I really need to wait for it to cool off before I eat it.",,,Liyue

943,Chongyun,Birthday,"On the anniversary of your birth, please accept this gift of a flower, made of ice crystals. I carved it myself. If you ever encounter an evil spirit, cast this toward it — the spell I have cast upon it will immediately come into effect and hopefully get you out alive. Also... Happy birthday.",,,Liyue

963,Faruzan,About Us: Student Recruitment,"Serious question: why don't you become my student? I'll tailor research topics to your needs and thoroughly explain everything you need to know.

964,Faruzan,About Us: Solving Puzzles,"When I was trapped, I spent so long solving puzzles that I became numb to even the flow of time.

965,Faruzan,About the Vision,"Hmph. My illustrious resume aside, my intellectual capabilities have been acknowledged even by the Anemo Archon himself. As for why I still can't find any students...

966,Faruzan,Something to Share: Kshahrewar,"""Going forward, Kshahrewar will be the only Darshan dedicated to the study of mechanisms""... Hmph, if you ask me, the Kshahrewar scholars have gotten way ahead of themselves. When I was cracking puzzles all over Sumeru, they were still playing with rudimentary building blocks.",,,Sumeru
967,Faruzan,Something to Share: Haravatat,"Those geezers at Haravatat love to decline my funding requests with the excuse that my research's become too niche and impractical. By that logic, since we're still the Darshan with the lowest enrollment numbers, we might as well close our doors altogether.",,,Sumeru
968,Faruzan,Interesting Things,"I've visited numerous ruins of all shapes and sizes and interpreted what scant texts and symbols I could find. Ruin Drakes are indeed mechanisms of the highest order.

969,Faruzan,About Lesser Lord Kusanali,"Knowledge is naturally something that cannot be limited or restrained. It's like how Kshahrewar can utilize Haravatat's research findings.

971,Faruzan,About Collei,"Ah, Collei... She's respectful toward her elders, diligent, and has a hard-working attitude — truly the perfect student!

973,Faruzan,About Layla,"Sometimes, she'll lower her head and keep her distance when she sees me. However, she's all smiles and greetings at night... I don't quite get her.

974,Faruzan,About Kaveh,"Kaveh's a good kid with great potential. I had a casual chat with him once about some principles of mechanism construction. Hmm, how should I put it... He's too much of an artsy romantic, but at least he has some original ideas, which is rare nowadays.

975,Faruzan,About Nilou,"I remember her; she's a courteous girl.

977,Faruzan,More About Faruzan: II,"Solving a truly ancient mechanical puzzle requires deciphering a deluge of ancient texts. I don't mean to boast, but they're probably on a completely different level from the ones you've solved on your adventures. Oh? Don't believe me?

979,Faruzan,More About Faruzan: IV,"As a scholar, I should have the courage to accept failure and shoulder all of its consequences. I never wanted anyone to pity me, whether it be back then or right now.

980,Faruzan,More About Faruzan: V,"My field of study is nowhere as esteemed as it used to be, and Haravatat has refused me funding more than once. Every now and then, Kshahrewar will try to invite me to teach under their banner, and the conditions they've offered me are truly out of this world. More students, a higher spending limit...

1010,Collei,Something to Share: Skill Names,"Master is always reminding me that practice makes perfect, so I sometimes try reading some light novels to improve my reading ability...

1058,Arataki Itto,About the Vision,"Ugh, don't even ask. Just the thought of it makes my blood boil! First, the Shogun's Army goes out and steals everyone's precious Visions — which, already a heinous crime, right? But then... then they go and stick them all over that statue with absolutely no sense of organization whatsoever. I mean, think about it... the more powerful the Vision, the higher up on the statue it should go, that would make sense, right?

1062,Arataki Itto,About Thoma,"Some of the boys have been telling me that he was the star of the show at the Vision Hunt Ceremony. I'm like — are you kidding me???

1063,Arataki Itto,About Kamisato Ayato,"Haha, I only wish I could have met Ayato sooner. He really taught me something. ""You can kindle the warrior spirit even in the weakest of bugs""... Yep, I really took that one to heart. If it weren't for those words of wisdom, I'm pretty sure I would have given up beetle fighting after losing for the 780th time...

1065,Arataki Itto,About Kaedehara Kazuha,"Word on the street is that he blocked the Musou no Hitotachi after you escaped from Tenshukaku. Seriously? 'Cause I mean, that is awesome!

1066,Arataki Itto,About the Raiden Shogun,"During the Vision Hunt Decree, the Shogun had to send her top tengu in person to get my Vision off me. Heh, means she must have found me to be quite the pain in the neck. But, y'know, she's abolished the Vision Hunt Decree now, so no hard feelings, I guess. As long as she's learned her lesson, of course.

1067,Arataki Itto,About the Lady with Fox Ears,"I crushed that Kitsune Ramen eating contest we had. Even all that Fried Tofu couldn't stand in my way — she didn't come close to beating me! ... I was, uh, bedridden for more than a month after that, but you know what? I'd rather lie in bed a winner than walk away a loser! So... Anyway, I had the last laugh, 'cause she had to foot the bill for 32 bowls of noodles! Haha!",Friendship Lv. 4,Yae Miko,Inazuma
1068,Arataki Itto,About Kujou Sara,"You know what, yeah, she beat me during the Vision Hunt Decree. I'm not ashamed to admit it. When you lose, you admit defeat, and when you screw up, you take it on the chin, like a man! And anyway, let's not forget which one of us won't agree to a rematch — her, the tengu warrior! It's just a sumo street fight, I mean, what's she so afraid of? If she keeps snubbing me, I'm gonna have to stop calling her Kujou Tengu and start calling her Kujou Chicken!

1069,Arataki Itto,About Gorou,"Oh yeah, the doggy general in the resistance... Hey, I've gotta hand it to him, he may be on the small side, but he's got quite the fighting spirit.

I mean, I've barely met the guy, so that's kinda weird.",Friendship Lv. 4,Gorou,Inazuma
1070,Arataki Itto,About Kuki Shinobu,"Nobody questions my leadership in the gang, what I say goes — except when it comes to Shinobu. She's always challenging everything I say. And not only that — all the hard-earned loot I bring back and share with everyone? She goes and returns it! But also, she gets me out of jail, and out of every mess we get ourselves into, so I'll let it slide. Besides, I don't wanna get on her bad side... An angry Shinobu would make my life a nightmare.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kuki Shinobu,Inazuma
1071,Arataki Itto,About Sayu,"All I did was give her a little pat on the head this one time when she wasn't looking, and now, she pounces to attack every time she lays eyes on me. Haha, what can I say? Tanuki are adorable! What am I supposed to do — not pat one on the head? ...Oh yeah, and that's the other thing — she beats you up for calling her a tanuki, too!

1072,Arataki Itto,More About Itto: I,"I know what you're thinking: ""I don't see it — how did this guy get to become the boss of the Arataki Gang on the back of beetle fighting and trading card games?"" Well, you're right, those are just child's play. Wanna know the hard skills that really got me where I am? Eating ramen standing upside down, sleeping with my eyes open, playing the harmonica with my nose, and swatting houseflies with my hair. Yeah, I know. Betcha see it now, huh?",,,Inazuma
1073,Arataki Itto,More About Itto: II,"People in Inazuma have this ritual every time there's a holiday, or they move, or get sick, or whatever, where they throw beans around and chant: ""Fortune beans are falling down, send the oni out of town. Fortune in, oni out. Fortune in, oni out!"" ...Ugh, the chant gets worse every time I hear it, but the streets full of beans, with my allergies? Total disaster.

1074,Arataki Itto,More About Itto: III,"In a... ""attempt""... to end human prejudice toward the oni, I had the gang use a Kamera to take a picture of me showing my softer side and stick it to the Message Board in Inazuma City. Next thing we know, some jerks have graffitied all over it! Tsk! Then, some ashigaru blockheads from the Tenryou Commission accused me of disrupting the peace, next it was the Yashiro Commission, complaining it ruined the atmosphere in the area, and finally, even the Kanjou Commission got involved — they sent some lackeys over demanding advertising tax!

1076,Arataki Itto,More About Itto: V,"I gotta respect the Blue Oni for sacrificing themselves so that the Crimson Oni could live on... In principle, though, I'm absolutely against it. No one should have to sacrifice their own kind for the sake of a better tomorrow, period. It's only a better tomorrow if it's a better tomorrow for everyone. We need to work together, not have everyone just focused on themselves, making their own sacrifice, trying to look cool in the process... Eh, I guess there's no changing the past, what's done is done. But from this day forward, no more sacrificing, not on my watch!

1078,Arataki Itto,Itto's Troubles,"Granny Oni isn't an oni at all... In fact, she's the kindest human that has ever lived. She only got her nickname because she took me in.

1079,Arataki Itto,Favorite Food,"Lollipops are pretty much the best things ever. The candy tastes awesome, but also, it looks really cool just having a stick hanging out of your mouth. It gives me, like... a real punk kind of vibe. Here, you try it!",,,Inazuma
1080,Arataki Itto,Least Favorite Food,"Uh, well I am an oni! So there's nothing I hate more than beans. Soybeans, Mung Beans, whatever, I hate 'em all.

1106,Furina,About the Vision,"Once the ancient prophecy came to an end and everything was over, I fell into low spirits for a very long time. People who stand on the stage basking in the adulation of their audience must also bear the pressures of being in the public eye and living up to everyone's expectations. But I knew very well my person wouldn't be enough, and that putting on the act of a god would be able the only way to satisfy their adoration... And at the end of the day, all I ever experienced was loneliness. So there came a point when I loathed the very thought of acting and locked myself in my room. It wasn't until the moment I stood on stage and faced the audience again that I realized the anxiety in my heart had dissipated. The reason I can now stand before the crowd's watchful gaze is perhaps because... I have finally started to act as myself.","Friendship Lv. 4; ""The Little Oceanid""",,Fontaine
1107,Furina,Something to Share: Opera,"Fontaine's opera house has seen several reforms, and with each reform, opposition was to be expected. As I remember, crowds would often gather in the opera house making a ruckus... That one time, it became so loud my ears were ringing. I frightened them by stating, ""I forbid anyone from discussing such pointless matters!"", I clearly remember Neuvillette tapping his cane on the ground at that precise moment while the whole place immediately fell silent. Sometimes I can't help but inadvertently show my intimidating side... I hope my people understands.  [sic]",,,Fontaine

1109,Furina,About Lyney and Lynette,"Of course I know Lyney and Lynette. I used to frequently attend their magic shows. Though they're very popular, they're still much less popular than me. Only my performances would draw a completely sold-out crowd... even standing tickets would be out. But now... Uh...

1110,Furina,About Neuvillette,"I'm very grateful to Neuvillette for all the hard work he's done for Fontaine in the past few centuries.

1111,Furina,About Navia: Desserts,"Have you tried Navia's macarons? I have to admit that her skills in dessert-making are comparable to mine.

Does it really all boil down to talent? Ugh, I can't believe I'm feeling a little jealous... I'll have to ask her for some tips next time!",Friendship Lv. 4,Navia,Fontaine
1112,Furina,About Navia: Inner Thoughts,"She's a very strong person. Strong people will always manage to keep themselves together no matter what happens, acting like everything is fine.

I saw the duel between Callas and Clorinde... and I can say that in this respect, Navia is becoming more and more like her father.",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,Navia,Fontaine
1113,Furina,About The Knave,"The Knave? W-Who's that? Oh... Uh, I'd already forgotten about her... Keeping such a terrible figure like her in your mind will only give you nightmares.",Friendship Lv. 4; Cataclysm's Quickening,Arlecchino,Fontaine
1114,Furina,About Charlotte,"I've often seen Charlotte busily running back and forth lately. She still seems to be hoping to arrange an exclusive interview with me. No matter how many times I refuse, she still hasn't given up. To be honest, her persistence made me angry at first... but then she told me with a resolute look in her eyes that she wanted to let people understand the real Furina, and that she believed people would understand my troubles. I don't know how to respond to her kind intentions... I suppose she might be right, but I'm just not ready yet...",Friendship Lv. 4; Masquerade of the Guilty,Charlotte,Fontaine
1115,Furina,About Wriothesley,"I haven't communicated with him much, but Neuvillette claims he's trustworthy, so I suppose he must be a good person. Oh, come to think of it, I've received some tea from Wriothesley before and it was exquisite!",Friendship Lv. 4,Wriothesley,Fontaine
1116,Furina,About Clorinde,"As I remember, Clorinde isn't very talkative, but she has stood by me and protected me on several occasions, so I trust her very much. Hmm... I do miss her ever so slightly, but I don't have any real reason to see her now. Oh, right! I should invite her to my next tea party!",Friendship Lv. 4; Masquerade of the Guilty,Clorinde,Fontaine
1117,Furina,More About Furina: I,"You're interested in hearing about me? *sigh* I suppose there's no helping that... After all, I was once the biggest celebrity of all Fontaine! Every day, countless journalists would come flocking around me, trying to get the inside scoop on my personal life, so I have loads of experience rejecting them. Of course, I don't intend to use this experience on you. With the right delicacies, I might be willing to exchange some of my secrets.",,,Fontaine
1118,Furina,More About Furina: II,"Someone recently recommended me to try surfing, so I went and gave it a shot. Keeping balance on the rolling waves was a little tricky at first, but I managed to get the hang of it pretty quickly. Maybe I'm just a natural surfer... Anyway, feeling the wind and waves up close and riding along the horizon was rather amazing. You should give it a try!",Friendship Lv. 3,,Fontaine
1119,Furina,More About Furina: III,"If you have time, could you tell me more about your journey? I would love to hear all your fantastic stories. How should I put it... I easily feel interested in all kinds of things, but it isn't long before I feel bored again. Perhaps the more easily enthusiasm sparks, the more quickly it fades. But, when I'm with you, I seem to constantly feel happy... Such an amazing feeling!",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
1120,Furina,More About Furina: IV,"Recently, I've been wondering if I've been a little too hard on myself in the past. In my efforts to maintain the reserved manner of a deity, I never got the chance to enjoy my life, which is why I've become obsessed with shopping lately. I've bought many new precious things... like dazzling rainbow-colored tea bags, fully-automated extendable cutlery, and a saddle specially made for riding Seahorses... But in the end, I realized that most of the stuff I bought was useless, so I sent them all to the troupe to be used as props in performances. Strange... before I bought those things, I was certain they would all be of good use to me...","Friendship Lv. 5; ""The Little Oceanid""",,Fontaine
1121,Furina,More About Furina: V,"People love talking about the past and often regret the beautiful things that have now faded into history. They also love to talk about the future, as if they're willing to sacrifice everything for an uncertain tomorrow. I don't agree with their way of thinking, yet I also feel very envious... I once lived in a world without a past or a future. To cope with that anxiety, I tried to create and act out a stronger, more god-like version of myself. Over the centuries, the stronger role I tried to play gradually merged with my real self. Even I can't separate the two now... but perhaps there's no need to distinguish them. Experiences of the past have formed who I am now, and that flawed performance has also become the most important part of me.",Friendship Lv. 6; Masquerade of the Guilty,,Fontaine
1122,Furina,Furina's Hobbies,"The Queen's Crown still doesn't have a sequel yet? Pity, a classic like that where justice overcomes evil never gets old.",,,Fontaine
1123,Furina,Furina's Troubles,"Hmm, what sauce should I pick for my macaroni tonight?",,,Fontaine
1124,Furina,Favorite Food,"No one complains about exquisite confectioneries, but it'll take a lot of effort to make some that I like. Listen carefully, desserts are like operas... Everything from choosing the characters to imagining the setting requires a lot of effort in order to make the final performance a hit!",,,Fontaine
1125,Furina,Least Favorite Food,"Simply put, I detest most of those ""creative"" dishes. I have tasted many wonderful dishes throughout the years which did nothing but leave me with some moments that I never want to look back on.",,,Fontaine

1128,Furina,Receiving a Gift: III,Ugh. Is this what you usually eat? *sigh* Seems I'll have to share some of my macaroni with you.,,,Fontaine
1129,Furina,Birthday,"Happy Birthday! Here, please take this ticket as your gift. It's a VIP seat to see Happy Day, just don't forget to show up to the performance! Hmm? What's ""Happy Day""? *sigh* Well, I wanted to keep it a surprise... But it's an opera that I've rehearsed personally. It's about a big group of people that gather together to celebrate a certain very important person. You understand now, right? Just don't forget to come!",,,Fontaine

1133,Furina,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"I didn't know you cared so much about me. Does that mean that you still need my power?

In that case, then let us act out our future journey together!",Ascension Phase 6,,Fontaine
1134,Kamisato Ayato,Hello,"Greetings. Ayaka has mentioned you on numerous occasions — alas, my schedule has been rather busier than anticipated recently, which belated our first meeting until today. Kamisato Ayato, head of the Kamisato Clan. Delighted to make your acquaintance.",,,Inazuma

1139,Kamisato Ayato,When Thunder Strikes,"Ayaka was always scared of thunder as a child — until one day, mother told her that the sound of thunder is the voice of the Almighty Shogun. After that, she would start focusing intensely every time she heard the sound of thunder, as if by concentrating hard enough, she'd be able to hear exactly what Her Excellency was saying.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma

1150,Kamisato Ayato,About Us: Most Entertaining,"Hehe, I heard about the little job you pulled at the Tenryou Commission. Most entertaining...

1151,Kamisato Ayato,About Us: Trust,"Trusting another person isn't easy, especially for someone of high status. Place your trust in the wrong person, and it can quite literally cost you your life.

1152,Kamisato Ayato,About the Vision,"A Vision is an eminently useful tool, so it only makes sense to put it to good use. Also, I like to think it's happiest in my possession because it has the chance to shine away in all its glory.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
1153,Kamisato Ayato,Something to Share,"If you throw fallen flowers onto the stove, the searing heat infuses them with one final spark of vitality, and for a brief moment, they radiate a more glorious glow than the flames themselves... it was a short life they lived, but it was by no means a wasted one.",,,Inazuma
1154,Kamisato Ayato,Interesting Things,"When it comes to pets... Mm, yes, I'm definitely more of a dog person myself. Cats are very independent, which has its merits, but you'll only find obedience in dogs. They'll do whatever you tell them to. Hehe, what can I say — I suppose I find loyalty to be quite an attractive quality.",,,Inazuma
1155,Kamisato Ayato,About Kamisato Ayaka,"I am confident in Ayaka's abilities. But I want her to be able to hold on to her innocence. She shouldn't have to get personally involved in power struggles, or confront the darker side of life head-on. As her older brother, it's my job to shield her from all of that... Heh, just... between the two of us, of course. Sorry, that got a little more private a little more quickly than I'd intended.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kamisato Ayaka,Inazuma
1156,Kamisato Ayato,About Thoma,"There is no doubt in my mind about Thoma's loyalty to the Kamisato Clan. A long time ago, partly to see where he stood, I advised him that he would be better off leaving if he didn't want to get drawn into the never-ending disputes that plague public life. Still, he chose to stay, and in all the time he's been with us, he's spared me much worry. There are very few people I trust completely these days, but Thoma is one of them.",Friendship Lv. 4,Thoma,Inazuma
1157,Kamisato Ayato,About Sayu,"She looks awfully idle the majority of the time, and yet when it counts, she always rises to the occasion and provides indispensable assistance. Of course, you'd know far more about that than me, wouldn't you?",Friendship Lv. 4,Sayu,Inazuma
1158,Kamisato Ayato,About Yoimiya,"Ah, the fireworks store owner. Yes, a most... spirited young lady. The Kamisato Clan is on rather close terms with her.

1159,Kamisato Ayato,About the Raiden Shogun,"The cost of pursuing eternity has been great for the Almighty Shogun... and for all of Inazuma.

1160,Kamisato Ayato,About Yae Miko,"Lady Guuji has been kind to us in the Kamisato Clan, but she has never quite taken to me personally. I trust you'll have heard the way she refers to me... ""the Yashiro rascal"" and other such flattering monikers. We run into each other semi-regularly, given the overlap in our work, and despite whatever private thoughts we each may have, our working relationship is quite a harmonious one. I have no great objection to this state of affairs — working with intelligent people always makes things highly efficient. In any case... However objectionable she might find me, she would be forced to admit that without me, she would have no one to help execute her weird and wonderful ideas.",Friendship Lv. 4,Yae Miko,Inazuma
1161,Kamisato Ayato,About Kujou Sara,"Old man Kujou capitalized on a golden opportunity to create a most formidable weapon indeed. The only flaw in his plan being, he is now no longer able to wield the weapon of his creation.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kujou Sara,Inazuma
1162,Kamisato Ayato,About Kaedehara Kazuha,"Once upon a time, the Kaedehara Clan was a subordinate branch of the Kamisato Clan. My forebears may have failed to save his family from decline, but even today I have a duty to support him. Now, naturally, there is nothing I can do to restore his clan's former fortunes. But as for helping him avoid arrest by the Tenryou Commission, that is well within my capabilities...",Friendship Lv. 4,Kaedehara Kazuha,Inazuma
1163,Kamisato Ayato,About Arataki Itto,"Now he's an interesting case. Pitting docile Onikabuto against each other in battle... heh, that's a first... I was only speaking in polite platitudes when I gave him that little pep talk, but to my surprise he started calling me ""bro""... To this day, he calls me ""my bro Ayato"" without the faintest idea of my true identity. It's quite alright by me, though, I have nothing against his... unique character.",Friendship Lv. 4,Arataki Itto,Inazuma
1164,Kamisato Ayato,About Ningguang,"I have heard a thing or two about how Her Eminence, the Tianquan operates.

1165,Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: I,"You want to know about me? Hmm. Things aren't always a case of the more you know, the better. Plenty of proverbs to corroborate that, as I'm sure you're aware. (Smile) Maybe we'll have the chance to talk more next time.",,,Inazuma
1166,Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: II,"Strange tastes, you say...? You seem to misunderstand me. Let me be quite clear: Most of the time, I simply enjoy watching people's facial contortions when they're put in an awkward position. Watching them squirm, you might say. Is that so strange?

1167,Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: III,"The Tri-Commission may appear calm and well-run, but I can assure you it is quite tumultuous beneath the placid surface. There is no pleasure to be had in mixing with the powers that be. I shall spare you the details. Just know that... I have never done anything to dishonor the Kamisato Clan. Neither in the past, when I was working to bring stability to our clan, nor here in the present, where I am working for the sake of all of Inazuma.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
1168,Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: IV,"You want to know about the Shuumatsuban? I suppose there's no harm in divulging a detail or two to you. It's a secret unit that reports directly to the head of the Kamisato Clan. Accordingly, after my father passed, it came to me. There are certain situations I cannot directly involve myself in, and in these cases, being able to rely on the Shuumatsuban is often instrumental in achieving a resolution. Most of its members are orphans whom we take in and raise from a young age. This way, loyalty is guaranteed to the greatest extent possible, and we are spared a great deal of worry.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Inazuma
1169,Kamisato Ayato,More About Kamisato Ayato: V,"Do I have other tricks up my sleeve beyond the Shuumatsuban? Well, naturally.

1172,Kamisato Ayato,Favorite Food: Personal Preference,"Variety is the spice of life. In that sense, the Milk Tea Medley they started serving over in Hanamizaka recently isn't half bad.

1215,Xingqiu,About Yelan,"Have you heard the expression ""same person, different face""? Ms. Yelan gives me precisely this feeling.

1247,Sucrose,About Sucrose: Bio-Alchemy,"Bio-alchemy, when compared with creation, places more emphasis on transformation.

1256,Sucrose,About Noelle,"She's... a very willing helper, I can't deny that. It's just... she makes me a little anxious is all.

1257,Sucrose,About Klee,"Jean has put her into solitary confinement so many times, but every time she's let out it's not long before she's back in trouble. *sigh* Something tells me she hasn't done much introspection.

1258,Sucrose,About Jean,"I don't dare talk to Master Jean that much, because she's so strict. I know she's a good person and all — I know that, I do — but... I still find her scary.

1259,Sucrose,About Lisa,"She really seems to know a great deal. She's obviously never seen my research, and yet on so many occasions she's given me advice on that which is most core to my studies. Just how does she know? Is it observation, or is it ratiocination?",Friendship Lv. 4,Lisa,Mondstadt

1261,Sucrose,About Albedo: Artistry,"As his assistant I learn so much each and every day. What's key is not his existing knowledge, but his talented way of thinking.

His methodologies are amazing... to me, it's where alchemy meets art.",Friendship Lv. 4,Albedo,Mondstadt
1262,Sucrose,About Albedo: Talent,"Talent? Let's hypothesize that he and I were to perform the same research — I'd still spend my whole life playing catch up.

1263,Sucrose,About Amber,"I'm curious as to why her doll is called ""Baron Bunny,"" it clearly has nothing to do with a rabbit at all. Oh, the headband makes it look like it has rabbit ears you say?

1328,Beidou,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"After all this training, I feel like I'm finally at my best. Thank you... But please, I'd still like for you to keep me on my toes.",Ascension Phase 6,,Liyue
1329,Yelan,Hello,"Hello, Traveler. Call me Yelan. I think you may need my help, and I just so happen to be interested in some information you have. In other words — you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours.",,,Liyue
1330,Yelan,Chat: Tip-Off,I got a new letter from an informant. Looks like the situation has changed again.,,,Liyue
1331,Yelan,Chat: Truancy,"Good roll... Alright, maybe I'll take one more day off, and knock out the rest of the work once I'm feeling up to it.",,,Liyue
1332,Yelan,Chat: Identity,Navigating the world is a whole lot easier with a few different identities to choose from. Need me to come up with some for you?,,,Liyue
1333,Yelan,When It Rains,"It's raining again? Oh, this isn't good... If the rain washes away the traces, it's gonna set us back a long way...",,,Liyue
1334,Yelan,When Thunder Strikes,Only innocent children and timid adults are scared of thunder. But you're not either of those... are you?,,,Liyue
1335,Yelan,When It Snows,It's getting a little cold... Time to bundle up.,,,Liyue
1336,Yelan,When the Sun Is Out,This blinding sunlight is such a pain... No way I can get a nap in this weather.,,,Liyue
1337,Yelan,When the Wind Is Blowing,There's a restlessness in the wind... Hmm...,,,Liyue
1338,Yelan,Good Morning,Mmm~ So early... I usually get up at noon if I don't have any urgent work.,,,Liyue
1339,Yelan,Good Afternoon,"Ah, I'm getting sleepy. Think I'll take a nap... Don't wake me. I'll wake up naturally when it's time to work.",,,Liyue
1340,Yelan,Good Evening,"Good evening. Have you had dinner? What did you have, how was it? Oh... Just making conversation. Don't think anything of it.",,,Liyue
1341,Yelan,Good Night,"Come on now, drink your milk and go to sleep. What? You're not a kid? Hehe... Alright, well, I'll just leave it right here, it's yours if you want it. I usually fall asleep well after midnight. Full disclosure — if you're a sleep talker, I can't promise I won't take notes, kay?",,,Liyue
1342,Yelan,About Yelan: Duties,"The Qixing know Liyue like the back of their hands. But there's certain information out there that can only be obtained using more specialized methods. That's my area of expertise, so I generally take care of all those assignments myself.",,,Liyue
1343,Yelan,About Yelan: Rumors,"Some say the boss of Yanshang Teahouse is a young entrepreneur who got rich overnight; some say there's a sickly and frail senior employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs living as a hermit outside the city; others say you should stay away from restricted areas, or you'll get haunted by a blue ghost... Obviously, most civilians have never heard the name Yelan before. So you can safely laugh off all these rumors.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
1344,Yelan,About Us: Relationship,Huh? What's that look on your face for? You don't have to be on guard around me. I never scheme against people who have my stamp of approval.,,,Liyue
1345,Yelan,About Us: Deception,"Don't be too ready to believe people when they cross their heart and hope to die. Sweet talkers only say what you want to hear. And think twice before meeting someone else's gaze — your eyes speak volumes about what you're thinking. When it comes down to it, we're friends, and if somebody ever conned you, I'd feel like I'd been cheated, too.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Liyue
1346,Yelan,About the Vision,"Wherever there's important information to be found, the stakes involved in extracting it are often fatal. It doesn't matter how big or reliable the team under you may be, you can never completely rule out the risk. The bottom line is, have enough force at your fingertips to control the situation. I got lucky — I got my Vision just a few days after realizing that. Otherwise... you'd probably be talking to a very disheveled-looking ghost right now.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
1347,Yelan,Anything to Share: Blocking Out Noise,"If you grind Loach Pearls down to size, they make excellent earplugs. They're very sound-proof — you can sleep away blissfully even when there's someone screaming right in your ear... Of course, I hope for your sake that you don't ever need them for that kind of reason.",,,Liyue
1348,Yelan,Anything to Share: Fascinating Bracelet,"The bracelet on my right hand? I suppose there's no harm in telling you... It contains a kind of magic used by our clan, and it can send simple messages. The meaning of those messages is buried in the blue light, and only I can decipher them.",,,Liyue
1349,Yelan,Anything to Share: Pursuing the Target,"When I'm tracking a target, I like to put psychological pressure on them. In the process of trying to shake me off, they will start to panic, bring in reinforcements, alter their plan... they keep going like this until eventually, they've exposed everything I need to know. Heh...",,,Liyue
1350,Yelan,Interesting Things,"Do you know much about Weasel Thieves? They're not especially intelligent creatures, but once you tame them, they can be trained to steal things and even pick locks. Pretty clear-cut case, isn't it — if even animals can be used as pawns with the right methods, the same has to be all the more true of people, who are constantly plotting and scheming against one another to begin with.",,,Liyue
1351,Yelan,About Ningguang: Relationship,"I got to know Ningguang a long time ago, before she was a Qixing, and we worked together for a while. Maybe I'm partly to thank for the fact that she became a Qixing so quickly. Hehe, who can say? Anyway, she was the one who recommended this job to me. It was a good choice, I'm very well-suited to it.",Friendship Lv. 4,Ningguang,Liyue
1352,Yelan,About Ningguang: Expectations,"Ningguang is good to work with. But I have to be mindful of our identities when I'm out in public. When I meet a Qixing as an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs, they're ""Sir"" or ""Lady"" to me.",Friendship Lv. 4,Ningguang,Liyue
1353,Yelan,About Ganyu,"Ah, the secretary... I could never work non-stop like she does, certainly not at that level of efficiency. I guess being half-adeptus must have its perks. Imagine not needing sleep to regain your energy levels...",Friendship Lv. 4,Ganyu,Liyue
1354,Yelan,About Keqing,"I don't really like people who cram their schedules full, because it doesn't leave any room for negotiation. If something happens that they didn't anticipate, it throws their plans into oblivion, impacting not just themselves but their coworkers, too. But the Yuheng is different. She works in a very methodical way. I always enjoy working with her.",Friendship Lv. 4,Keqing,Liyue
1355,Yelan,About Yanfei,"I like Yanfei a lot. And I'm not talking about our friendship — as a high-profile legal consultant, important intel in Liyue Harbor is constantly flowing in her direction. Whenever I help her out, I always get some invaluable leads in return. I gotta say though, sometimes I think she respects me a little too much.",Friendship Lv. 4,Yanfei,Liyue
1356,Yelan,About Xiao,"The elders in my clan once said that we must always show the utmost respect to the Vigilant Yaksha. Apparently, the only time that our ancestor would gain some temporary relief from his insanity was when passing by the Wangshu Inn. It must have been the comforting effect of his presence that wards off evil spirits. That said, if I ever have the honor of fighting side by side with the Conqueror of Demons, I will focus only on the mission. I cannot let myself be distracted by concerns about his status.",Friendship Lv. 4,Xiao,Liyue
1357,Yelan,About Xiangling,"Ah, Xiangling, the lovely little chef. Her ingredients are always top quality, easily as good as Liuli Pavilion and Xinyue Kiosk. Sometimes I go to her for dried Jueyun Chilis... She doesn't seem to understand why I eat them in the way that I do, and I don't feel like trying to explain it to her, either. It's just a family tradition.",Friendship Lv. 4,Xiangling,Liyue
1358,Yelan,About Xingqiu,"Of course I remember him — the young master of the Feiyun Commerce Guild. I have dealings with his family all the time. Who knows... maybe one day, he'll be outsmarting everyone around him, too.",Friendship Lv. 4,Xingqiu,Liyue
1359,Yelan,About Tartaglia,"The Fatui harbinger? He helped me out once — unwittingly. I was planning a deep-reaching investigation into the former owner of the Yanshang Teahouse, but our harbinger friend got to him first. He showed up demanding payment of his debt, and also exposed his accounting fraud, which got him thrown in jail. That made it very easy for me to take over Yanshang Teahouse myself, and it's proven to be a very useful base.",Friendship Lv. 4,Tartaglia,Liyue
1360,Yelan,More About Yelan: I,"The reason I'm willing to bet on you is because of your special status. I think it'll bring me a lot of leads that can get me closer to the truth... Heh, so, got any news for me today?",,,Liyue
1361,Yelan,More About Yelan: II,"Exchanging information has to be a two-way thing, so I guess I can tell you something about my past. Thanks to my family's connections, I learned some useful skills from the Millelith scouts very early on. Although there are things working against you every step of the way when you're gathering intelligence, as long as I keep myself alive, I'll always emerge as the winner in the end...",Friendship Lv. 3,,Liyue
1362,Yelan,More About Yelan: III,"Clues are links in a chain. You have to trace them all the way back to where everything began before there can be a resolution. To that end, I need to keep my eyes and ears on every part of society, and often, that means having to be more than one person. People sometimes describe me as ""one person, many faces"" and so on... I take it as a compliment.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
1363,Yelan,More About Yelan: IV,"Someone once warned me to be careful about digging up certain things from the past. Dig too deep and you might find yourself standing in your own grave, they say... Well, I'm not about to stop, least of all because of anything anyone else has to say. Sure, I can't change the facts, but if it's a choice between the cold, hard truth and blissful unawareness, I'll take the former. What about you? Which would you choose?",Friendship Lv. 5,,Liyue
1364,Yelan,More About Yelan: V,"Tell me something. If I'm gonna stay around, what kind of person do you want me to be to you? Someone you work with? A competitor, who challenges you to sharpen your game? Just another name on your long list of acquaintances, or... somebody more important than that? Depending on what you're hoping for, I can either play that part or become that person.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Liyue
1365,Yelan,Yelan's Hobbies,"In my free time, I live life completely at random. It's quite simple: I make a list of things to do, then I roll the dice to decide which one I'm going to do next. It's a surprisingly fun game, and it's really broadened my mind... in that sense, it's been quite helpful where my job is concerned.",,,Liyue
1366,Yelan,Yelan's Troubles,"My physical fitness isn't actually that great compared with some trained martial artists. It's a hereditary thing that runs in my family. So before getting into really important work, I adjust my schedule to make sure I get enough rest, wait till I have built up enough energy, then strive to finish everything that needs doing in one go. Outside of work, I try my best to live life at a calm and carefree pace. So I'll always decline to take on any strenuous physical labor.",,,Liyue
1367,Yelan,Favorite Food,"I like to grind dried Jueyun Chilis and Violetgrass stamens into powder, mix them in with some Yunlai White Tea leaves, and then brew a strong pot of tea. It has the most powerful fragrance that makes you instantly fall in love with it. I prefer drinks like this with a long-lasting aftertaste to things like coffee and spirits.",,,Liyue
1368,Yelan,Least Favorite Food,"You have to be very careful with sweets. That powerful sense of satisfaction... it weakens your willpower and makes you relaxed. It only takes a few bites to get addicted, and with long-term consumption, you'll slowly but surely lose your edge.",,,Liyue
1369,Yelan,Receiving a Gift: I,"Hm, not bad. Almost good enough to bribe me with.",,,Liyue
1370,Yelan,Receiving a Gift: II,"Once you get accustomed to spicy food, everything else tastes bland. That's just the way it is.",,,Liyue
1371,Yelan,Receiving a Gift: III,Shall we roll some dice? Whoever gets the lowest number... gets to eat it.,,,Liyue
1372,Yelan,Birthday,"If I was to tell you that maybe you shouldn't celebrate too hard today, because you'll let your guard down, and someone out there might just be waiting for that moment to make their move on you... it probably wouldn't go down very well. So, relax and take it easy today. Oh, and you should stop by the Yanshang Teahouse — I whipped up some treats especially for you. Not sweet ones, of course. Just the tiniest little hint of chili.",,,Liyue
1373,Yelan,Feelings About Ascension: Intro,"In my line of work, combat skills are essential.",Ascension Phase 1,,Liyue
1374,Yelan,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up,"Sometimes, you have to strike hard and fast at just the right moment to expose the lies while avoiding any unwanted interference.",Ascension Phase 2,,Liyue
1375,Yelan,Feelings About Ascension: Climax,"Finding the truth might sound simple, but it takes perseverance to stick to the trail of clues and it takes strength to follow them deep into dangerous territory.",Ascension Phase 4,,Liyue
1376,Yelan,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"I have long regarded you as my most important informant. Naturally, I need to be fully prepared to face whatever risks come with the final answer when you bring it to me. Come on, let's go get it!",Ascension Phase 6,,Liyue
1377,Eula,Hello,"Captain Eula Lawrence, Spindrift Knight, Knights of Favonius Reconnaissance Company. I extend to you my greetings. Huh? What's that...? Yes, Lawrence, the evil aristocrats of historical infamy. Oh, we're still very much evil. Just look at me, I'm infiltrating the inner ranks of the Knights of Favonius, all as part of a diabolical plan to exact our revenge and reclaim our former glory!",,,Mondstadt
1378,Eula,Chat: Etiquette,"Knights and aristocrats share the same cultural heritage, but the knights had enough sense to do away with all the superfluous detail.",,,Mondstadt
1379,Eula,Chat: Bladework,"You want to learn some Favonius Bladework? Heh, alright then, I'll teach you.... Oh yes, I'll teach you, alright, mark my words...",,,Mondstadt
1380,Eula,Chat: Rules,"Aristocratic etiquette is all just for show... Just smile and nod along! I was forced to learn all of the rules by heart, but even I don't take them that seriously.",,,Mondstadt
1381,Eula,When It Rains,"Quick, under the umbrella, or you'll get soaked! You can't risk catching a cold, because it might turn into something more serious, and if that happens... Well, I can't go avenging my clan by picking on the sick now, can I?",,,Mondstadt
1382,Eula,When Thunder Strikes,"This weather is a hindrance. The thunder drowns out all other sounds, hampering my perception of the surrounding environment.",,,Mondstadt
1383,Eula,When the Sun Is Out,"Visibility is excellent! If we head to higher ground, we can do a full recon of enemy activity in the area.",,,Mondstadt
1384,Eula,Good Morning,"Rise and shine! The two-hour period before sunrise is the perfect time to strike, because the sentries are getting drowsy towards the end of their long night shift.",,,Mondstadt
1385,Eula,Good Afternoon,"Go easy on the grains at lunch and fill up on lean meat instead. If you get drowsy in the afternoon, anyone who's looking for an opportunity to take you down will make their move.",,,Mondstadt
1386,Eula,Good Evening,"""May the gentle breeze softly send thee into a sweet sleep."" ...One of a select few aristocratic pleasantries that's actually quite lovely.",,,Mondstadt
1387,Eula,Good Night,"Would you like to hear a lullaby on the bone whistle? It'll send you into a deep and everlasting sleep... Hmm, no. When it comes to my revenge, far more imaginative means of retribution are in order...",,,Mondstadt
1388,Eula,About Eula: The Knights,"The easiest way to destroy your enemy is to take them down from the inside, right? That's why I joined the Knights of Favonius.",,,Mondstadt
1389,Eula,About Eula: Bearing,"Since I'm a genuine Knight of Favonius, I fulfill my duties like any other self-respecting individual would. Look, I may be a descendant of a disgraced ruling elite, but I'm not a total degenerate!",,,Mondstadt
1390,Eula,About Eula: Scout,"The role of a scout is to hunt down enemy troops, or fend off the enemy in side skirmishes away from the main battle. There aren't a whole lot of rules, which suits my style very well indeed!",,,Mondstadt
1391,Eula,About Eula: Dance,"Not all customs of the Lawrence Clan are despicable. At least the ""Dance of Sacrifice"" is pure and noble. It puts my mind at ease and gives me comfort. It's been years, but it's still dear to me. My body remembers every step that I... Well anyway, to end this digression, those who wish to master my signature ""Favonius Bladework"" technique have to pass my dance class first.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
1392,Eula,About Us: Commonality,"We're not so different, you and I. We're both outsiders in Mondstadt. Difference is, Mondstadt welcomes you with open arms, but they treat me with hostility and suspicion...",,Mona,Mondstadt
1393,Eula,About Us: Feud,"Our feud is for the long term, so rather than get payback on a piecemeal basis, I think I'll make things easier for myself and wait for a day when I can settle the score once and for all. It could be in ten years, could even be twenty... But don't worry, I won't forget. In the meantime, I'll need you to take good care of yourself and have a happy, healthy life, okay?",Friendship Lv. 6,,Mondstadt
1394,Eula,About the Vision,"""Descendant of a depraved dynasty"" isn't the most flattering reputation to have. The only way I can shake it for good is if I keep avenging my kin in my own way. Those who desire vengeance need power first, so it makes sense that I would get a Vision.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
1395,Eula,Something to Share: Bone Whistle,"My bone whistle makes a versatile range of sounds, which comes in handy for confusing the enemy. I often use it to imitate the sound of the sea, which is where I get my title of ""Spindrift Knight"" — this despite the fact that the bone whistle is actually a Liyue tradition.... But then again, no one seems to look too closely into that kind of thing. I'm mean, they took me on, and I'm an exile of Mondstadt trained by an outcast of Liyue...",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
1396,Eula,Something to Share: Wine-Tasting,"Technically, aged Dandelion Wine should be poured into a silver goblet and allowed to breathe for 12 minutes, then you're supposed to add ice cubes, ideally so 60% of the ice is submerged beneath the wine. I refuse to do all that though, it's not worth the hassle.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
1397,Eula,Interesting Things,"Why do Mist Flowers have to be so rare? The powder they produce works wonders for the bone whistle. It gives it a crisper, clearer sound.",,,Mondstadt
1398,Eula,About Amber,"Amber's someone who thinks for herself. On the day I first joined the Knights, she cleaned my dormitory and gave me a tour of the headquarters, and she's helped me with a myriad of other things in the time since. Now, everyone looks at me like the older sibling who needs the younger sibling to do everything for them! Hmph. For this, she must pay!",Friendship Lv. 4,Amber,Mondstadt
1399,Eula,About Jean,"The Acting Grand Master's family and mine are sworn enemies. But she draws a clear line between professional and personal matters. She saw I was capable, admitted me into the Knights, and gave me lots of opportunities. So, when the time comes for vengeance, I'll afford her a reasonably soft landing.",Friendship Lv. 4,Jean,Mondstadt
1400,Eula,About Lisa,"She's so annoying. She must have read thousands of books... could even be tens of thousands. Meaning, she can effortlessly recall any number of vile tales about the Lawrence Clan's corruption off the top of her head, accurate down to the exact date. Logically speaking, she'd be the perfect person to talk to about someone I'd like to track down, but... swallowing my pride would be too great a challenge.",Friendship Lv. 4,Lisa,Mondstadt
1401,Eula,About Barbara,"Everyone loves her. What's her secret? Maybe I could learn a thing or two from her... Hmm, or maybe not. I can't imagine a ""Shining Idol"" would want anything to do with a descendant of a depraved dynasty.",Friendship Lv. 4,Barbara,Mondstadt
1402,Eula,About Varka,"Hmph, the Grand Master... He doesn't like to beat around the bush and has no care for rumors or trivial matters. A good guy, I guess. I sparred with him once, which ended in a tie, but his relaxed expression and leisurely attitude clearly indicated that he had been holding back the whole time... Such indignity! I will not let it go!",Friendship Lv. 4,Varka,Mondstadt
1403,Eula,About Venti,"I heard that bard sing a few songs about the Lawrence Clan... They were lighthearted and funny stories that mocked the clan in a way I've never heard anyone else do. Even I couldn't help but burst out laughing... And for this, he must pay!",Friendship Lv. 4,Venti,Mondstadt
1404,Eula,About Razor,"Free from social mores and other people's opinions, and no family obligations... Must be an easy life!",Friendship Lv. 4,Razor,Mondstadt
1405,Eula,About Sucrose,"The alchemist... She once gave me a piece of equipment and told me it would help me infiltrate an Abyss Order camp undetected. In reality, it caused a huge explosion that completely blew my cover and before I knew it I was being accosted by 13 mitachurls... Afterwards, I marched straight back there, intending to make her pay for what she had done, but when I saw how panicked and sheepish she looked, and watched her post her results on the wall with the word ""Fail,"" I couldn't bring myself to go through with it... After all, I didn't get hurt, just a little disheveled... and a little humiliated.",Friendship Lv. 4,Sucrose,Mondstadt
1406,Eula,About Diluc,"I don't get along with some of the knights, and he doesn't think much of them in general, so you'd think that would make us allies. But the way he always acts so aloof — he's even worse than Acting Grand Master Jean. I want nothing to do with him.",Friendship Lv. 4,Diluc,Mondstadt
1407,Eula,About Diona,"Diona? She's a miracle worker when it comes to making cocktails, and to my surprise, we get along really well. She infiltrated a tavern with the hopes of tearing down the wine industry, while I infiltrated the knights to exact my revenge on them. A kindred spirit it seems...",Friendship Lv. 4,Diona,Mondstadt
1408,Eula,About Yanfei: Encounter,"This one's a long story... We ended up saving her life once when we were tracking down a batch of dangerous cargo that belonged to the Abyss Order. The Abyss Order had packed it up like regular cargo and wanted it shipped from Dornman Port to Liyue Harbor. She was acting as a consultant for the merchant vessel, where she discovered something in the cargo — and then began to investigate, putting herself in grave danger. Had we arrived just a few minutes later, it's likely she wouldn't have been so fortunate.",Friendship Lv. 4,Yanfei,Mondstadt
1409,Eula,About Yanfei: Assessment,"We've kept in touch ever since. I like how smart she is. She knows the rules, but she also knows how to be flexible and act according to the situation. A few of the Knights would do well to take a leaf out of her book... Also, with her smarts, maybe she could help me track someone down that I've been looking for... She does owe me a favor from last time, after all.",Friendship Lv. 4,Yanfei,Mondstadt
1410,Eula,About Mika: Communication,"When Mika was assigned to the Reconnaissance Company, I thought that he'd only last a few days, just like the others before him. But he surprised me. He never made a peep, but he completed all of his tasks quite admirably. He even volunteered to run errands for me, and assist with communication... Hmph... I don't know who is going around telling people that I need looking after...",Friendship Lv. 4,Mika,Mondstadt
1411,Eula,About Mika: Returning,"Mika's personality hasn't changed one bit since he's been out with the expedition, though his abilities have improved significantly. The Grand Master is clearly making sure nobody neglects their training... Hmm? Mika's unaware of his own improvement? It must be one of his blind spots... or perhaps he's just being humble. Either way, things like this don't escape me. I know my team.",Friendship Lv. 4,Mika,Mondstadt
1412,Eula,More About Eula: I,"The life of a Lawrence doesn't include much worth talking about... Basically, whatever you say, whatever you do, people will always despise you and treat you like a potential threat to society. It's nowhere near as bad as it used to be, though. Before I'd joined the Knights, good grief... I couldn't even buy groceries. Even Good Hunter and Mondstadt General Goods wouldn't take my money. I literally had to go out and hunt my own food and cook it over a campfire if I wanted to eat dinner.",,,Mondstadt
1413,Eula,More About Eula: II,"People tell me that if I just spoke more softly, or was more polite, or acted more deferentially, others may find it easier to forgive me, but the only reason they think that way is because they've never been branded a pariah before. There is no easy path to redemption when you're a social pariah. I'm more inclined to stop tiptoeing around everyone all the time and just get out there and make them respect me the old-fashioned way! As in, we square off and if they win, I humbly accept my punishment, but if they lose, they must acquiesce to my demands... Such as... Well, I mean, if I want to buy a loaf of bread, take my darn money, for crying out loud!",Friendship Lv. 3,,Mondstadt
1414,Eula,More About Eula: III,"The Knights of Favonius are actually fairly reasonable, at the very least they reward merit and not social status. The reason they invited me to join their ranks is because I'd sparred with some of their crack troops and won through my own sheer skill. Being an insider in the organization will make getting revenge much easier, as it removes many of life's complications, so what's not to love?",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
1415,Eula,More About Eula: IV,"The name Lawrence only became a social stigma after the clan fell from grace. It was once an honor to be called a Lawrence, but unfortunately, most people have forgotten about that part of history. The Grand Master says that I am performing rather well as a knight, and that if it's not enough to restore the honor of the Lawrence name, it's certainly a strong rebuttal against the one-sided opinions so many people throw around. I'm quite satisfied with that appraisal.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Mondstadt
1416,Eula,More About Eula: V,"If my family members refuse to change their corrupt ways, or worse, continue to cause active harm in Mondstadt... I should be the one to end them, along with the Lawrence name itself. For once, it'd be a family obligation I'd actually enjoy. And once the deed was done, I'd be free to pick any name I wanted. Or even let you pick one for me!",Friendship Lv. 6,,Mondstadt
1417,Eula,Eula's Hobbies,"I'm into all sorts of cool things. Sipping a nice cold drink, sitting in a canyon feeling the biting wind howl past my face, or diving into the lake at the foot of Dragonspine... Waiting for you to stroll by unsuspectingly, so I can sneak up behind you and drag you down into the icy depths...",,,Mondstadt
1418,Eula,Eula's Troubles,"Sometimes, when it's busy in the tavern, they ask me to share a table with other customers. But once they find out that I'm a Lawrence, suddenly everyone gets indignant and provocative, and starts trying to bait me out in some way. I just want to have a drink, is that too much to ask!?",,,Mondstadt
1419,Eula,Favorite Food,"I like making my own treats. Not always your typical sweet treats, though. For example, a Chilled Tomato and Aspic Jelly Egg Roll pairs very nicely with an ice-cold glass of Berry & Mint Punch. The most important thing is that they leave the people who like eating them with big smiles on their faces.",,,Mondstadt
1420,Eula,Least Favorite Food,"I can't stand a rich broth. The flavor is too overpowering, it's so filling you can't train or fight afterward, and also, it doesn't really work as field rations... Simply put, broth and I are sworn enemies!",,,Mondstadt
1421,Eula,Receiving a Gift: I,Oh? Are you putting me to the test? Challenge accepted.,,,Mondstadt
1422,Eula,Receiving a Gift: II,"Eh, not that great... How about you try it?",,,Mondstadt
1423,Eula,Receiving a Gift: III,"The nerve on you, are you exacting revenge?",,,Mondstadt
1424,Eula,Birthday,"Today is a day worth observing, though you shouldn't mark your development in age alone. Accept my gift of a bone whistle, and allow me to teach you its secrets. When your day of reckoning comes, see how long you can fend me off with it... It'll make the whole thing much more exciting.",,,Mondstadt

1461,Kamisato Ayaka,More About Kamisato Ayaka: II,"The Kamisato Clan once suffered a major blow when we failed to protect a swordsmith of national significance. We were harassed by the Fatui, we lost many of our people, and we received a great deal of criticism. It all aged Father greatly, and severely damaged the Kamisato Clan's standing within the Shogunate. Brother has worked tirelessly to reverse the trend since he assumed leadership, but although our clan's position is now restored and the Yashiro Commission is unified once more, we still rely on Brother to make the decisions on all matters of any importance.","Friendship Lv. 3; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",,Inazuma
1462,Kamisato Ayaka,More About Kamisato Ayaka: III,"The art of blade forging taught by the Shogun varies based on astrology, application, materials used, the furnace conditions, individual personalities, and elemental changes. These differences between smiths is what gave rise to the Raiden Gokaden. Swordsmiths capable of forging renowned blades are seen as spiritual personnel with sacred abilities, and as such they should be managed by the Yashiro Commission, which oversees all cultural, artistic, and ceremonial affairs. So naturally, the swordsmith's betrayal is the fault of ineffectual management by the Kamisato Clan.","Friendship Lv. 4; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",,Inazuma
1463,Kamisato Ayaka,More About Kamisato Ayaka: IV,"My mother was the most incredible person. She was always so dignified and elegant, always smiling, no matter what situation she might be facing. She had so much to deal with in the clan on so many levels, but she took it all in stride — it was like nothing could ever faze her. Everything about her was perfect, and I say that without exaggerating. *sigh* But the moment she passed away, I realized... I couldn't hide behind my mother any longer. I wasn't little Ayaka any more.","Friendship Lv. 5; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",,Inazuma

1498,Wanderer,About Lesser Lord Kusanali,"While I still had value as a pawn, she might have had other reasons to keep me alive.

1545,Keqing,About Keqing: Self-Reflection,"After I took on the management of so many of Liyue's affairs, I had a new-found respect for Rex Lapis and all his hard work over the last millennium. Recently, every time I come up against a difficult problem with no obvious solution, I find myself thinking: What would Rex Lapis do? Maybe he really IS an expert in everything, and I've got more left to learn than I realized...",A New Star Approaches,,Liyue
1546,Keqing,About Us: Pursuing,"You know why I like you? It's because you don't believe something just because it was said by a god. You make up your own mind. You ask the questions everyone else is too cowardly to ask, and when you don't get an answer, you keep looking till you find one. Oh don't worry — your way is definitely the right way. Who says gods don't make mistakes, anyway?",,,Liyue
1547,Keqing,About Us: Trying,"It's not difficult, you'll see. Just give it a try. What if you try and it doesn't work out? ...No, I don't believe that will happen. You've never let me down before. You don't seem the type.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Liyue
1548,Keqing,About Us: Encouragement,"I used to be so naive. I genuinely believed that I was on a par with Rex Lapis... Seems I really overestimated myself. Hmm? Yes... You're right! I have plenty of self-confidence in other areas, so why not in this? ...I can catch up with him — I WILL catch up with him! I just need to keep my chin up, keep trying, and keep learning!",Friendship Lv. 6; A New Star Approaches,,Liyue
1549,Keqing,About the Vision: Skepticism,"If a Vision means the approval of the gods, then I don't see why I should want one. In fact, I find it quite insulting... It's like trying to say everything I've ever achieved is all thanks to the gods looking out for me! Well, I got to where I am today through hard work. The gods had nothing to do with it.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
1550,Keqing,About the Vision: Reflection,"Oh, so... Rex Lapis wanted me to have power beyond the average mortal so that I can be a great leader? Huh...

1551,Keqing,Something to Share: Initiative,"In addition to my work with the Liyue Qixing, I do a lot of work for the public, too.

Maybe I should start with a half hour instead?",,,Liyue

1553,Keqing,Interesting Things,"I once heard a Mondstadt fable about courage being what it takes for birds to learn to fly.

For me, Liyue is that boundless sky.",,,Liyue
1554,Keqing,About Zhongli,"The gentleman from the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor? Clearly, he's an extremely learned individual, and I do have a lot of respect for him.

1557,Keqing,About Ningguang: Cooperation,"Since Rex Lapis left us, we've actually found some common ground.

1564,Keqing,About Ganyu: Skepticism,"Who knows what Rex Lapis must have done to inspire such blind devotion from Ganyu... But her reluctance to be critical is not without its advantages.

1565,Keqing,About Ganyu: Reflection,"I find myself getting a second opinion from her a lot these days. Lots of things come up that I just have no idea about, and of everyone in Liyue, she's probably the most familiar with Rex Lapis. Heh...

1567,Keqing,About the Anemo Archon,"Since Rex Lapis left us, the question of Liyue's future has been on my mind constantly. In addition to reviewing his own past deeds, I've been researching the other archons' modes of governance, too.

It's completely beyond me.",Friendship Lv. 4; A New Star Approaches,Venti,Liyue
1568,Keqing,About Yanfei,"The way I see it, the law is a summary of things done the right way in the past.

1576,Keqing,Keqing's Troubles,It's great that the quality of life in Liyue is improving for everyone.

The Liyue Qixing did not put in all this effort to create a more prosperous society just so people like them can loaf around.,,,Liyue
1577,Keqing,Favorite Food,"It makes no logical sense to be greedy with food, but for me, all rationality goes out the window when there's Golden Shrimp Balls involved... They're just irresistible.

1578,Keqing,Least Favorite Food,"Everything has a certain way it should taste. I won't touch anything that tries to break the mold, so no salted Almond Tofu for me, and no sweetened Lotus Seed and Bird Egg Soup either. It's just a total waste of perfectly good ingredients.",,,Liyue

1600,Kujou Sara,About Kujou Sara: Preparing for War,"Am I ready to depart? Let me put it to you like this. If you were to make a habit of asking me this question every time before you move out, you would find that you only receive an answer from me one time out of 10.

1609,Kujou Sara,About Kamisato Ayaka,"In the Kujou household, normally the only sound to be heard is that of soldiers training in the dojo. But in the Kamisato household, there is the sound of music, dance, bickering, and laughter...

1610,Kujou Sara,About Yoimiya,"As long as she is not setting off fireworks in my camp, I will cause her no trouble. Heh, yes, I know — all else aside, her fireworks are spectacular and brilliant, and she deserves all the praise she gets. The issue for me is that fireworks are fleeting in nature. After one brief moment of dazzling light, all that remains is the pitch-black night sky, the same as before. So I often have to caution myself not to become too captivated by this illusory spectacle.

1611,Kujou Sara,About Shikanoin Heizou,"Shikanoin and I may be colleagues, but I have few positive words to say about him.

1613,Kujou Sara,About the Raiden Shogun: Service,"So, the Vision Hunt Decree was repealed... Yes, it seems that you were right. ...Ahem, but this is not to say that the Almighty Shogun made a mistake. She has simply chosen to pursue eternity by a different route.

1614,Kujou Sara,About Yae Miko,"Guuji Yae's actions often leave me with many questions... Nevertheless, the fact that she is the head shrine maiden of the Grand Narukami Shrine clearly shows the level of trust and approval that the Shogun places in her, and for this reason I also greatly respect her.

1615,Kujou Sara,About Sangonomiya Kokomi,"She is more proficient as a military strategist than a priestess. The way she uses directives to wage war is almost unheard of.

That just makes it even better.",Friendship Lv. 4,Gorou,Inazuma
1617,Kujou Sara,About Arataki Itto,"Tsk... I can't help but get a little irate when his name comes up. He kicked up a big fuss when I confiscated his Vision, by far the noisiest person... no, the noisiest oni I've ever encountered.

1618,Kujou Sara,About Kuki Shinobu,"With her talent and qualifications, it's a shame she decided to join the Arataki gang.

1619,Kujou Sara,About Kirara,"Recently, I often feel a mysterious gaze from the shadows that disappears as soon as I turn to look. What an absurd prank... Huh? A nekomata, you say? Huh... She should've just come right up to me if she needed something.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kirara,Inazuma

1621,Kujou Sara,More About Kujou Sara: II,"I lead a relatively simple life when I'm not leading an army into battle. I always get out of bed at 5:05 on the dot.

1622,Kujou Sara,More About Kujou Sara: III,"The thing that gave me the most trouble when enforcing the Vision Hunt Decree was those officers of the Shogun's Army who would abuse their authority to be heavy-handed with those we detained.

1639,Lynette,Chat: Older Brother,Seems Lyney is saying some strange things again... it's really worrying.,,,Fontaine
1640,Lynette,Chat: Spacing Out,Entering Standby Mode... I hope nobody disturbs me.,,,Fontaine
1641,Lynette,When It Rains,Rainy days are perfect for spacing out...,,,Fontaine
1642,Lynette,After the Rain,The skies have cleared? What a pity.,,,Fontaine
1643,Lynette,When Thunder Strikes,Ow... that hurts my ears.,,,Fontaine
1644,Lynette,When It Snows,So cold... let's hide you in a hat!,,,Fontaine
1645,Lynette,When the Sun Is Out,There is nothing new under the sun... Is that really true?,,,Fontaine
1646,Lynette,When the Wind Is Blowing,"*sniff* What's that on the breeze? ...Nope, it's nothing.",,,Fontaine
1647,Lynette,Good Morning,Good morning... Not fully recharged. Now snoozing again.,,,Fontaine
1648,Lynette,Good Afternoon,"I usually drink a cup of tea before work. Not only does it change my mood, but also helps me stay alert.",,,Fontaine
1649,Lynette,Good Evening,"After the sun goes down, the desires hidden in people's hearts will rise to the surface... I mean, evening shows are spectacular. Should I reserve a ticket for you?",,,Fontaine
1650,Lynette,Good Night,"Go to sleep, I still have some loose ends to tie up from work today... (I still have to fix the vacuum cleaner I broke.)",,,Fontaine
1651,Lynette,About Lynette: Magic,"During our shows, I'm usually Lyney's assistant. Because I never speak or change expressions, people often mistake me for a puppet... this kind of misunderstanding can prevent unnecessary social interactions, so it's actually quite nice.",,,Fontaine
1652,Lynette,About Lynette: Intelligence Reports,"Staying silent is beneficial for maintaining focus and gathering intelligence. Once, a VIP audience member at our show took out a handkerchief that didn't belong to his wife... as for how such information is used, now... that depends on what Father wants.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
1653,Lynette,About Us: Listening,"I'm not accustomed to expressing myself, but I consider myself a good listener. If you have any troubles, come find me. I'll guard your secrets.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
1654,Lynette,About Us: Interests,"I used to think that the golden sun and dark shadows of the night could never understand one another. But in you, I see a kind of strange complexity that has needlessly piqued my curiosity... I'll have to keep a close eye on you.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
1655,Lynette,About the Vision,"I prefer to use my eyes to understand the situation and find an appropriate solution, as opposed to using martial prowess. But having brute force as an option greatly increases the potential cards at your disposal, and enables you to protect those most important to you in a crisis.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
1656,Lynette,Something to Share,"Making tea looks simple on the surface, but it is actually quite complex. The quality of the tea leaves, the temperature of the water, the number of times to add water... Only when every variable is properly controlled can tea of the purest taste be brewed. Would you like a cup?",,,Fontaine
1657,Lynette,Interesting Things,"Animals can also express their feelings. If you listen carefully, you can tell what state they are in. For a kitty, ""Meow~"" means they are much happier than ""Meow meow meow!"", and in that situation, you can pet them as much as you want and they won't run away.",,,Fontaine
1658,Lynette,About Lyney: Unspoken Understanding,"I have always been together with Lyney, and we can tell what the other is thinking without speaking. Thus, he tends to be more quiet than normal when we are alone. Hmm? Can I tell when he's lying or telling the truth? Of course I can, but this matter is top secret.",Friendship Lv. 4,Lyney,Fontaine
1659,Lynette,About Lyney: Worries,"Lyney is normally quite confident, and does everything with incredible ease... or at least, that's how he wants everyone else to see him. So when he runs into difficulties, he always wants to solve everything perfectly on his own... if this happens, please be sure to take good care of him.",Friendship Lv. 6,Lyney,Fontaine
1660,Lynette,About Freminet,"He is a delicate and gentle child, but also tends to belittle himself... perhaps due to his previous experiences. Sometimes he feels like the antithesis of Lyney... but since they're both family, when their opinions clash, I will bridge their differences.",Friendship Lv. 4,Freminet,Fontaine
1661,Lynette,"About ""Father""","Oh, how ""Father"" expresses love... well, not everyone can accept it. But it is only because of ""Father"" that home... can be called home.",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,Arlecchino,Fontaine
1662,Lynette,About Neuvillette,"The Chief Justice always feels strangely aloof, though his words are always humble... or perhaps he just doesn't like dealing with humans? After all, when he speaks with Melusines, he's actually quite friendly.",Friendship Lv. 4,Neuvillette,Fontaine
1663,Lynette,About Furina,"Lady Furina's behavior is incredibly hard to explain, and I can't discern any useful intelligence from observing her. I always feel like her every move and action is an act, and she is playing different people... She truly is an Archon, one cannot apply the logic of ordinary humans to her.",Friendship Lv. 4,Furina,Fontaine
1664,Lynette,About Navia,"Though she's the new president of Spina di Rosula, her style is more like the nosy big sister next door. If we really had a sister like her in the ""House of the Hearth,"" that would be really great... I know I probably shouldn't be wishing for anyone to be an orphan, but...",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,Navia,Fontaine
1665,Lynette,About Clorinde,"I was once ordered to observe a duel of hers. Even just as a bystander, the coldness radiating from her was absolutely chilling... I don't know what it would be like to face her directly in a duel, and I hope I will never find out.",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,Clorinde,Fontaine
1666,Lynette,About Chiori,"The costumes Lyney and I wear for performances were specially tailored by Chiori. Once, Lyney was using a small knife for a magic trick, and accidentally cut the cuff of his sleeve a bit. She scolded us nonstop... it was scary. Luckily, I can hide behind Lyney whenever we go to her shop.",Friendship Lv. 4,Chiori,Fontaine
1667,Lynette,About Charlotte,"Uh... I was eventually cornered by her for interviews a few times. The way she persistently asked even after Lyney rejected her all those times, I really have to commend her perseverance. Too bad for her, though... despite preparing all those questions, I never answered a single one.",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,Charlotte,Fontaine
1668,Lynette,About Emilie,"Her perfume products are so popular that you have to get in line before the break of dawn to have a chance at snapping any up. However, I'm far too sensitive to the smell of perfume, and it's really rude to sneeze... so I have to take the long way around.",Friendship Lv. 4,Emilie,Fontaine
1669,Lynette,More About Lynette: I,"If you explain a magic trick, then the allure of the performance is lost. Personal relationships are the same. If you want to understand me, why not learn a bit at a time, and gradually piece together a complete picture?",,,Fontaine
1670,Lynette,More About Lynette: II,"Humans are complicated creatures. Even when they are not doing so intentionally, they will still unconsciously hide their true selves. Though I can always notice a few ""redundant"" details, I won't expose their facades when it isn't necessary.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Fontaine
1671,Lynette,More About Lynette: III,"Magic shows were once our livelihood, but now they are more of a convenient identity to present to society. In the name of magic performances, we can easily gain more access throughout the city, and be the ""eyes"" of our House.",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,,Fontaine
1672,Lynette,More About Lynette: IV,"Before Lyney and I came to our new home, we were constantly adrift on the streets. We experienced many hardships and dangerous situations... It was then that I developed the habit of paying attention to any sign of danger, and also gradually learned to understand what others were thinking. Fortunately, we now have a safe place to live.",Friendship Lv. 5; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,,Fontaine
1673,Lynette,More About Lynette: V,"Building a relationship with someone is like gambling. No matter how much information you have, it's hard to predict how other people might change. I've always had the habit of keeping a safe distance from others, but in your case... I'm willing to shoulder the risk of losing a bet.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
1674,Lynette,Lynette's Hobbies,"A person's mental state is like a bowstring. If it's constantly under high tension, it will be at risk of suddenly snapping. So outside of work, I prefer to do things that relax my brain, like making tea, feeding cats, and just zoning out. The calmer one normally is, the easier it is to deal with crises when they do pop up.",,,Fontaine
1675,Lynette,Lynette's Troubles,"I tend to have difficulties operating any kind of machinery. As soon as I stop paying attention, all kinds of things start to go wrong. Once, I even broke the dryer on a rainy day... At least Freminet is good at fixing things.",,,Fontaine
1676,Lynette,Favorite Food,"Pry open the shells, squeeze a bit of lemon juice onto the fresh shellfish... no plate necessary. Perfection.",,,Fontaine
1677,Lynette,Least Favorite Food,Dishes should not be over-seasoned. Good food preserves the original taste of the ingredients.,,,Fontaine
1678,Lynette,Receiving a Gift: I,Delicious. I've already memorized the recipe.,,,Fontaine
1679,Lynette,Receiving a Gift: II,Thank you for your generosity.,,,Fontaine
1680,Lynette,Receiving a Gift: III,Perhaps you could reconsider the spice ratio a bit?,,,Fontaine
1681,Lynette,Birthday,"Happy Birthday [sic]! Let me give you this card... it's not a greeting card, so of course nothing's written on it. Write down what kind of present you want, place it in my hat, and no matter what it might be, you'll get it.",,,Fontaine
1682,Lynette,Feelings About Ascension: Intro,My perception has been heightened.,Ascension Phase 1,,Fontaine

1685,Lynette,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,I never imagined I could become this powerful... looks [sic] like I won't need to hide behind you anymore.,Ascension Phase 6,,Fontaine
1686,Dehya,Hello,My name's Dehya. I'm the merc you hired. So what you got for me? A commission? A fight? Armed escort? Whatever it is — you know where to find me.,,,Sumeru
1687,Dehya,Chat: Mercenaries,We mercs have one simple rule: Whoever pays the most is your new boss.,,,Sumeru
1688,Dehya,Chat: Desert,"The desert's a tough adversary, but at least it doesn't hide anything. What you see is what you get, and whether you take on the challenge is entirely up to you.",,,Sumeru
1689,Dehya,Chat: My People,"My people are used to the desert life... But still, I hope that one day, they'll be able to find an oasis of their own, and leave the sandstorms behind for a better life.",,,Sumeru
1690,Dehya,When It Rains,"According to some of the older Eremites, it does actually rain in the desert on occasion. And when it does, it's always a lot heavier than this.",,,Sumeru
1691,Dehya,When Thunder Strikes,"Man, this thunder is loud. They won't hear us coming... or vice versa.",,,Sumeru
1692,Dehya,When It Snows,*grimace* ...Are you kidding me? This is even colder than the nights in the desert...,,,Sumeru
1693,Dehya,When the Sun Is Out,"Ah, sun's out, guns out, hehe... Just sucks that I got so much work to do.",,,Sumeru
1694,Dehya,When the Wind Is Blowing,Wind's picking up... Let's play it safe and pitch camp downwind of our target.,,,Sumeru
1695,Dehya,In the Desert,"Stay close, no going off on your own. The desert doesn't take prisoners.",,,Sumeru
1696,Dehya,Good Morning,Ready to roll? Good. Then let's pack up and move out.,,,Sumeru
1697,Dehya,Good Afternoon,"Where did the morning go... Alright, soon as I see a good spot, I'll set up the stove and cook us some lunch.",,,Sumeru
1698,Dehya,Good Evening,"You're still working at this hour? Ugh, and I thought we mercs had it tough.",,,Sumeru
1699,Dehya,Good Night,"It's late. Go get some rest, I'll take the night watch.",,,Sumeru
1700,Dehya,About Dehya: The Eremites,"""The Eremites"" is just a title — any mercenary in Sumeru can call themselves a member. Sadly, you get some mercs throwing the term around to take advantage of outlanders who don't know any better... Hmph. We've got those jerks to thank for the increasingly abysmal reputation we have these days.",,,Sumeru
1701,Dehya,About Dehya: Dad,"...Kusayla was his name. As a merc, he had a slapdash way of working and a whole lot of bravado. But he also saved me from the desert, and did whatever he could to pass on to me everything he had.Without him, I wouldn't be who I am today.",Friendship Lv. 4; Lionsblood,,Sumeru
1702,Dehya,About Us: Great Deeds,"Your recent feats have been doing the rounds, you know. In my brigade alone, a lot of people have been talking about the things you've achieved. I've even had several people ask me if I can introduce them to you.",Lionsblood,,Sumeru
1703,Dehya,About Us: Comrades-in-Arms,"""Friends""? Hmm... I dunno, after everything we've been through, all the battles we've faced together? Somehow, ""friends"" just doesn't quite do it justice.I think... yeah, ""comrades-in-arms"" sums it up best for me. The bond we share can only be forged in the heat of battle. It's one of the most unbreakable bonds there is.","Friendship Lv. 6; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",,Sumeru
1704,Dehya,About the Vision,"How's my life changed since getting my Vision? Huh... Well, obviously it gives me an extra edge in battle, but honestly, the biggest thing for me is that it's helped me bring a few more mercs into the Blazing Beasts...",Friendship Lv. 4; Lionsblood,,Sumeru
1705,Dehya,Something to Share,"You know Ajilenakh Nuts, right? I used to go crazy for them as a kid... but my dad was the worst at shelling them. He'd just hack 'em to pieces with his knife, leaving a bunch of inedible mush behind. In the end, he'd salvage what he could by scraping pieces of the flesh off the shell, then mixing it with some milk and calling it porridge....I do miss the taste of that porridge sometimes... and I miss that old nut-cracker, too.",Lionsblood,,Sumeru
1706,Dehya,Interesting Things,"A lot of people see the Red Vulture as an omen of death and disaster, because it feeds on the carcasses of the dead. But the way it soars high above the desert... I've always seen it as a symbol of the tenacity of life.I wonder what the Great Red Sand looks like from all the way up there.",,,Sumeru
1707,Dehya,About Tighnari,"Hahaha, the one that got away... I came thiiis close to doing a job for that guy. A contact put us in touch — I was supposed to be his guide through the desert for some kind of investigation. But then it got canceled out of the blue, no idea why. Wait, actually... I think there was something about him not being good with the heat? I'm not sure, but it could have been that...",Friendship Lv. 4,Tighnari,Sumeru
1708,Dehya,About Lesser Lord Kusanali,"Hmph... You know, I always thought the Akademiya's worst were just a bunch of greedy dogs, each fighting for their slice of the pie... Nope. Turns out they were a vicious pack of wolves who betrayed the whole nation. If you want my opinion... Lesser Lord Kusanali was too good to them. Those animals didn't deserve her mercy — she should've broken every single bone in their bodies! Instead, they got a nice little vacation in the rainforest... To say they got off lightly is just putting it mildly.","Friendship Lv. 4; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",Nahida,Sumeru
1709,Dehya,About Candace,"Ah, Candace... I love her to bits, but she can be as stubborn as a Sumpter Beast sometimes. I keep telling her she oughtta cut herself some slack, take some time off, maybe go take a walk around Sumeru City, buy herself some nice new clothes or jewelry... but she always says the same old thing: She can't bear to leave the village unprotected. I dunno how many times she's turned me down now. Ugh, if I really can't persuade her, I guess I'll just have to watch the village for her sometime, and get one of my Eremite girls to take her shopping...","Friendship Lv. 4; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",Candace,Sumeru
1710,Dehya,About Alhaitham,"He offered me a position in the Akademiya once. I declined — working in a place like that would bore me to death. He, on the other hand, is exactly the kind of person I can imagine working there... always talking in long, convoluted sentences, and in that snooty tone... Tsk.","Friendship Lv. 4; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",Alhaitham,Sumeru
1711,Dehya,About Cyno,"The General Mahamatra? Doesn't suffer fools gladly, and certainly doesn't beat around the bush. Having seen the way he works, he gets a thumbs up from me.",Friendship Lv. 4,Cyno,Sumeru
1712,Dehya,About Nilou,"Now that the whole saga with the Akademiya's over, I guess she can finally dance as much as she wants. She offered me some of her face powder last time I saw her, but I didn't have the time to go fetch it. So I told her to give it to Candace instead. Hmm... I wonder how she's liking it? I need to go check sometime...","Friendship Lv. 4; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",Nilou,Sumeru
1713,Dehya,About Dori,"Ah, the famous merchant. I've heard that her prices aren't cheap, but is it true that she can get a hold of anything you want? Hahaha, then I should start talking to her, 'cause uh... some of the supplies we mercs need are impossible to get anywhere else on the market, no matter what you're willing to pay.",Friendship Lv. 4,Dori,Sumeru
1714,Dehya,About Layla,"Ahh, the sleepy girl, yeah, I think I remember her. I ran into her once at an oasis on the outskirts of the desert. She was out with some group from the Akademiya doing astronomical observations, or something. I wasn't really paying attention. ...Huh? Candace... what now? Emissary from the stars? The heck is that all about? Almost sounds like she didn't wake up before getting out of bed.",Friendship Lv. 4,Layla,Sumeru
1715,Dehya,More About Dehya: I,"I've lived around Eremites my whole life. As a little girl, I had a wooden sword for a toy. Everyone I knew growing up was either a merc or on their way to becoming one, and even the bowls we ate our meals from were carved by mercenary blades... After an upbringing like that, it'd be more surprising if I didn't become a merc when I grew up, right?",,,Sumeru
1716,Dehya,More About Dehya: II,"Where do I feel like I belong? No idea. I've never thought about that sort of thing before. If I had to pick... I've lived most of my life in the desert, so I guess that makes me a desert-dweller.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Sumeru
1717,Dehya,More About Dehya: III,"Being a merc is tough. The work itself is one thing, but the worst part is trying to get your client to pay you after you finish the job. The Akademiya's top of my list — they're pretty straightforward. The Adventurers' Guild isn't too bad either. But trading merchants can be a total nightmare. They're always telling me that their funds are tied up, so cash is tight, yadda yadda. ""Just a few more days,"" they say.If cash is so tight, how'd you pay for that big pile of goods on your cart, hmm? Tsk.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Sumeru
1718,Dehya,More About Dehya: IV,"The Akademiya have taken a kinder view of us since everything that went down. I heard that they even released a ton of new regulations to support the desert folk. Hmph, it'd take me till the end of time to read and understand all that documentation... I just hope from now on, the Wall of Samiel will only mark the place where sandstorms end, rather than my folks' hopes and dreams.","Friendship Lv. 5; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",,Sumeru
1719,Dehya,More About Dehya: V,"Most mercs are looking to make their fortune and leave their mark. They take on the hardest jobs they can find, hoping to earn as much Mora and prestige as possible. Some are lucky enough to survive and become legends, while others disappear into the desert before anyone's learned their name.I don't have any grand aspirations though. I just want to keep the people I care about safe, so they can live their lives in peace. Of course, I won't complain if I can make some extra Mora along the way, haha.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Sumeru
1720,Dehya,Dehya's Hobbies,"I looove my make-up box. Sometimes I take it out and re-organize it when I have the time. I keep all my powders and brushes in here — paid top Mora for all of it. Just look at this texture! Isn't it just perfectly smooth? And even if you sweat or get caught in the rain, it doesn't run. Hehehe, you get what you pay for.",,,Sumeru
1721,Dehya,Dehya's Troubles,"Some clients are behind on their payments again, and a few of the guys got themselves into trouble during their last job... *sigh* I'm not the boss, but somehow everything ends up being my problem...",Lionsblood,,Sumeru
1722,Dehya,Favorite Food,"Candied Ajilenakh Nuts, no contest. Easy to take on the road, and of course delicious.",,,Sumeru
1723,Dehya,Least Favorite Food,Anything bitter. Nope. Keep it away from me. Can't stand it.,,,Sumeru
1724,Dehya,Receiving a Gift: I,"This tastes amazing! I'd better not have any more, or I'll never be able to go back to my usual rations.",,,Sumeru
1725,Dehya,Receiving a Gift: II,"Mmm, not bad... compared to rations, anyway.",,,Sumeru
1726,Dehya,Receiving a Gift: III,"You know, if nothing else, it's uh... filling, and if it fills you up — it's good grub! Hahaha...",,,Sumeru
1727,Dehya,Birthday,"Happy Birthday! Reach into your pocket, your present's already in there. How'd I do it? Hehe, just a little trick of the trade. Anyway, more importantly, I've booked us a real feast at Lambad's Tavern, so let's get ourselves over there! ...Huh? Oh, don't worry, I didn't invite any of the other mercs. Nah, that rowdy bunch is always getting into arguments — not the kind of people you'd want at a birthday celebration. It'll just be me and you, like it should be... Ahem, c'mon, c'mon, let's go.",,,Sumeru
1728,Dehya,Feelings About Ascension: Intro,Huh? How about that... I really did get stronger.,Ascension Phase 1,,Sumeru
1729,Dehya,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up,"Hey, this feels good. I think I'll be able to hit quite a bit harder with my sword now.",Ascension Phase 2,,Sumeru
1730,Dehya,Feelings About Ascension: Climax,So much power... I have to go test this out. You down to spar with me or what?,Ascension Phase 4,,Sumeru
1731,Dehya,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"I never once imagined I could get to this level... All credit goes to you. What next? Do you have a job for me? Whatever it is, just say the word and I'll be there.",Ascension Phase 6,,Sumeru

1735,Bennett,Chat: Self-Deprecation,"""Good things come to those who don't wait around!"" That's what they say, anyway. Knowing my luck, the opposite is probably true for me...",,,Mondstadt
1736,Bennett,When It Rains,It always rains when I go on an adventure.,,,Mondstadt

1741,Bennett,Good Afternoon,"I brought a sandwich. You want some? I'll give you hal- *choking* *spluttering* ...Phew. Sorry, nearly choked to death there!",,,Mondstadt
1742,Bennett,Good Evening,"Hey, wanna go talk to my dads for a bit? They tell the best adventure stories!",,,Mondstadt

1745,Bennett,About Bennett: Bad Luck,"Eh, it's not as bad as you've heard! Everyone falls into a trapper's pit or gets hit on the head by a falling tree now and then, right?",,,Mondstadt
1746,Bennett,About Us: Teammates,"Hahaha, you wish! Benny's Adventure Team has had no vacancies in ages... I mean, you must be spoiled for choice, right? Why'd you wanna join the unluckiest adventurer alive, anyway?",,,Mondstadt
1747,Bennett,About Us: Division of Labor,"From now on, I'll distract the monsters and set off the traps while you grab the treasure. Sound good? ...You don't like it? Oh — don't worry about me getting injured! It's what I'm best at... And for you, it would be my pleasure!",Friendship Lv. 6,,Mondstadt
1748,Bennett,About Us: Dangerous Places,"I think I get why you teamed up with me now. It's 'cause we're the same, you and I — we both like that adrenaline rush you get from being in dangerous situations. That's what makes adventuring so addictive!",Friendship Lv. 6,,Mondstadt
1749,Bennett,About the Vision,"Getting recognized by the gods was the last thing I expected, seeing as how I'm so unlucky all the time. But if the gods haven't given up on me, I guess that means I shouldn't give up on me either.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
1750,Bennett,Something to Share,"Do you wanna come and see the view of Mondstadt from above some time? It's real pretty at night, when the city's all lit up and you can see the moon reflected on Cider Lake... Huh? From where? Haha, well, there was this one time when I got picked up by a tornado and ended up on this cliff way up high— Not interested? Oh, okay then, never mind.",,,Mondstadt
1751,Bennett,Interesting Things,"I actually quite like cabbage. It's not much to look at, but you can't imagine a world without it. You can grow it anywhere, it goes with everything, and the flavor never gets in the way. I dunno, there's something... nice about being ordinary.",,,Mondstadt
1752,Bennett,About Barbara,"She's the best singer and dancer out there! I always go to watch her in concert after an adventure goes south — it really lifts my mood, chanting along with all the other fans, cheering her on. It's really kinda magical! It's no wonder she's so popular... Boy, if I had even half her popularity as leader of my adventure team...",Friendship Lv. 4,Barbara,Mondstadt
1753,Bennett,About Klee,"She's a cute kid... but I have to keep my distance. Whenever she plays with me, her bombs always end up going off... It's not so much me I'm worried about, it would just be awful if something happened to Klee. The Knights of Favonius would never forgive me, that's for sure.",Friendship Lv. 4,Klee,Mondstadt
1754,Bennett,About Fischl,"Oh yeah, the Prinzessin der Verurteilung from the world beyond! She's amazing. I keep asking her if we can go adventuring in her home world together, but each time I bring it up she sort of avoids the topic... She's probably just worried about my safety. Her home world sounds like a dangerous place, for sure.",Friendship Lv. 4,Fischl,Mondstadt
1755,Bennett,About Jean,"I keep meaning to ask Master Jean for some help with the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild, but I don't know how to go about it. The Guild doesn't have as many rules and regulations as the Knights of Favonius, the dads and I are pretty laid back about everything. Pretty sure that attitude wouldn't fly with Jean though... I guess I should read up on the Knights' etiquette or something?",Friendship Lv. 4,Jean,Mondstadt
1756,Bennett,About Varka,"He's my role model! Talk about team leaders — he's the Grand Master! Leads the whole darn Knights of Favonius! How incredible do you have to be to do that!? Recently, though, I've been thinking that having a smaller Adventure Team isn't such a bad thing after all. I mean, if things got too busy in the team, I'd have no time to look after all my dads in the guild, would I? Yeah... Yeah, things are fine the way they are.",Friendship Lv. 4,Varka,Mondstadt
1757,Bennett,About Razor,"Wolvendom guy! Looks a little on the feral side... doesn't talk much... but he's alright! We both love eating meat, so we got that in common. I sometimes cook some meat for him, and he teaches me how wolves communicate in return. Haha! You should join us next time!",Friendship Lv. 4,Razor,Mondstadt
1758,Bennett,About Amber,"Oh, I know who you mean. The girl who's always charging around all over the place. She's always off adventuring in the wild, just like me... But if you ever see her near a cooking pot, you'll soon find a cloud of thick black smoke blowing in your direction, followed by the smell of burnt steak... Huh, maybe she was born unlucky too?",Friendship Lv. 4,Amber,Mondstadt
1759,Bennett,About Noelle,"Noelle's someone I've been watching for a while. She's really talented, and extremely hardworking. But somehow she's still a maid — the Knights of Favonius still haven't made her a knight. It's a shame, don't you think? Boy, if she switched to the Adventurers' Guild, she'd easily be one of the best there is.",Friendship Lv. 4,Noelle,Mondstadt
1760,Bennett,More About Bennett: I,"Oh... you wanna know about me? Haha, I'm just your average adventurer. 'Cept I'm more unlucky than average. Anyway, I'm nothing compared to you — you're the star of all those legendary tales. What do I got to show for myself?",,,Mondstadt
1761,Bennett,More About Bennett: II,"""The dads..."" That's how I refer to all the older adventurers in Mondstadt. Apparently, I was an orphan kid that they rescued from the most perilous situation ever. How cool is that? I have such terrible luck all the time, and yet I was rescued against the odds and survived all this time. It's a miracle if you ask me.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Mondstadt
1762,Bennett,More About Bennett: III,"You've, uh, noticed then... Heh. Yeah, Benny's Adventure Team has been me on my own for a long time now. Reason is, I have such bad luck that even the most benign of adventures end up turning into the adventure from hell, and no one wants to come with me... Do you feel the same way?",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
1763,Bennett,More About Bennett: IV,"I was born unlucky. That's just the way it is, and I've lived with it so long now that I'm just used to it. But you know what? Maybe it's a good thing. It means I know that whatever luck I do have left is gonna run out sooner rather than later... so I'd better make the most of my life while it lasts. You know, go on plenty of adventures, meet loads of people... I mean, if I didn't live like that, I may never have even met you! Can you imagine? Haha!",Friendship Lv. 5,,Mondstadt
1764,Bennett,More About Bennett: V,"Time flies! We've been a team for a while now, haven't we? Anyway, I have a dream I wanna tell you about. Once the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild becomes the biggest branch in Teyvat, I wanna go adventuring all over the whole world! Benny's Adventure Team will be the greatest adventure team there ever was, because you and me are the greatest adventurers! ...""Since when?"" Uh... I don't remember exactly when you signed onto Benny's Adventure Team. But whatever, it's just details, right?",Friendship Lv. 6,,Mondstadt
1765,Bennett,Bennett's Hobbies,"I like all kinds of things, but most of all, I like adventures! One day I'm gonna find the most valuable treasure in the whole world, and then my dads can have a better life... and the Mondstadt Adventurers' Guild will be back in business!",,,Mondstadt
1766,Bennett,Bennett's Troubles,"Hmm... Well, if you really wanna know... When I have a bad day, I feel a bit glum. Like, it sucks when I come back empty-handed from an adventure, or when one of my dads' old injuries start acting up. But... they're just small things, really. After a good night's sleep I forget all about them. New day, new start! Haha!",,,Mondstadt
1767,Bennett,Favorite Food,"Meat! Meat is the best sustenance there is. Chicken-Mushroom Skewers, Steaks, and Sweet Madames are all my specialties. You won't go hungry if you come adventuring with me, that's for sure!",,,Mondstadt
1768,Bennett,Least Favorite Food,"You can't really afford to be picky as an adventurer. That said, I can't really handle spicy food. I find it hard to breathe after eating Jueyun Chilis, like the spice went right into my lungs. And there's no avoiding the diarrhea afterward... It's the devil's fruit, I say. Who knows where it came from?",,,Mondstadt
1769,Bennett,Receiving a Gift: I,"Whoa, lucky me! Haha... Oh wait! Does that mean I just used all of my good luck for today...?",,,Mondstadt

1776,Bennett,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"Thanks to your help, I should finally be able to keep everyone safe now. Hopefully, people's opinions of me will start to change.

1792,Xiangling,About the Vision,"Any time, night or day, I am always willing to make dishes everyone loves.

1793,Xiangling,Something to Share,"If you get a stomach ache, a cup of herbal tea with Silk Flowers will clear it up in no time! Huh? Of course you can trust my herbal remedies! We chefs are expected to know a thing or two about medicine as well, you know!",,,Liyue

1796,Xiangling,About Ningguang,"That was the Tianquan! Did you see? She just walked past. Come here... closer... Let me tell you, she knows everything that happens in Liyue, so... keep a low profile, don't attract her attention!",Friendship Lv. 4,Ningguang,Liyue
1797,Xiangling,About Hu Tao,"Is Hu Tao picking on you too? Ugh, that prankster always waits till I least expect it, creeps up on me from behind and then... Boo! ...then laughs herself silly. Hmph.

1798,Xiangling,About Diona,"Diona, from Springvale! Ah, I heard she mixes a great drink, so I came specifically to see her! I thought perhaps I could use her secrets in my cooking, and bring out more flavors. But the tips that she gave me — like soaking lizard tails in beer, or putting bits of smoked fish in dandelion wine — all came out really awful. *sigh* Guess it's up to me to work it out myself, then.",Friendship Lv. 4,Diona,Liyue
1799,Xiangling,About Beidou,"Oh, Beidou is the greatest! Every time I go out sailing with her, she always manages to fish up lots of fresh ingredients! Octopus tentacles go great in soup, and seaweed fries up great with some chilies. Not just Beidou, but everyone on board The Crux loves my cooking.",Friendship Lv. 4,Beidou,Liyue
1800,Xiangling,About Zhongli,"I've come across a lot of fussy eaters, but Mr. Zhongli is very particular and has no problem getting straight to what he has to say. The first time I served him salt and pepper tofu, he took just one bite, and then proceeded to say: ""It would be better to try sea salt extracted from the shallow seas of Guyun Stone Forest, because it would bring a fresh sense of depth to the tofu."" I tried it and the taste was just so different! He's just amazing, don't you think!?",Friendship Lv. 4,Zhongli,Liyue
1801,Xiangling,About Chongyun,"Chongyun? I always see him on his way to eat at Wanmin Restaurant with Xingqiu... Ah... or perhaps I should say I see him being dragged there by Xingqiu? Chongyun doesn't eat hot food. Every time the hot food arrives, Xingqiu politely apologizes and proceeds to try every dish. I just wanna dig in with him! The look on Chongyun's face is priceless. They're quite interesting, those two.",Friendship Lv. 4,Chongyun,Liyue
1802,Xiangling,About Ganyu,"Ganyu? Oh... Oh yeah! I remember her — vegetarian, right? She doesn't come to the Wanmin Restaurant very often — but when she does, she sits alone in the corner and eats her meal in total silence. Poor girl, she seems kinda lonely... I always give her an extra-large portion because I feel sorry for her. Funniest thing is, she eats every last bite, every time! I wouldn't have guessed she had such an appetite just by looking at her.",Friendship Lv. 4,Ganyu,Liyue
1803,Xiangling,About Yaoyao,"Hee-hee, I'm proud to call her my junior! She hasn't swung by the Wanmin Restaurant in ages, though. Maybe master is trying to protect her from me or something... Last time we hung out, I was about to dig into some fresh raw octopus from the Sea of Clouds, but not only did she stop me from eating it, she sent master to tell me off too! Ugh... Honestly, sometimes it feels like I'm the one who gets treated like the junior...",Friendship Lv. 4,Yaoyao,Liyue
1804,Xiangling,About Xinyan,"Xinyan always comes to the Wanming Restaurant for a late-night snack! She gobbles up all the new dishes that the likes of Xingqiu and Chongyun don't go near... and nine times out of ten, she enjoys them too! She's great.",Friendship Lv. 4,Xinyan,Liyue
1805,Xiangling,About Yelan,"Yelan? Of course, I remember her! When I first met her, I was certain she'd be the kind of gal who'd prefer lighter dishes... turned out that she can handle the most spice out of all my customers! Apparently, my dishes weren't spicy enough for her, because she started taking bites of raw Jueyun Chilis! Truly amazing.",Friendship Lv. 4,Yelan,Liyue
1806,Xiangling,About Gaming,"Oh boy, once I know Gaming is coming, I make sure to prepare a huge pot of tea in advance. You know, so he can wash some of the spicy food down. I've offered to tone down the spice a bit for him, but he absolutely insists that he prefers the authentic flavor... And he's not even just saying that to be polite.

1809,Xiangling,More About Xiangling: III,"My heart's desire? To start my very own cooking tradition, of course! Li-style and Yue-style cooking are good, but they have a limited palate.

1842,Nahida,Something to Share,"Very often, only once we get hurt badly are we finally forced to face our own laziness, ignorance, recklessness, or arrogance. There's nothing to regret, though.

1845,Nahida,About Cyno: Duty,"Not every General Mahamatra would take such a clear-cut and decisive stance when faced with a conflict between order and justice.

1852,Nahida,About Faruzan,"She is suffering from exposure to remnants of King Deshret's power.

1854,Nahida,About The Seven: Games,"I hear that playing games is a good way to quickly bring people closer together. I'm sure it must work for gods, too. How about once everyone meets up, I suggest we play hopscotch together? ...Hmm, on second thought, maybe not.

That wouldn't be fair on the others.","Friendship Lv. 4; Akasha Pulses, the Kalpa Flame Rises",,Sumeru
1855,Nahida,About The Balladeer,"When he finally achieved the ambition he thought he'd been pursuing all along, was he content at last, or only emptier still?

1856,Nahida,About Furina,"People often say that wisdom isn't about what you know, but knowing what you can change.

1858,Nahida,More About Nahida: II,"In my dreams, there's often a flower pot. Every time I water it and add fresh fertilizer, the same flower grows.

1859,Nahida,More About Nahida: III,"In my dreams, there's often an hourglass. I like to add a few drops of water. Then, I shake it up, and time how long it takes to settle, and see if there's any difference from the last time. There's no reasoning behind it and nothing to gain out of it, but somehow it seems to relieve the exhaustion in my brain. I think that the fact that it's for nothing is what makes it fun for me.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Sumeru
1860,Nahida,More About Nahida: IV,"In my dreams, there's often an empty space. No matter how the scenery changes around it, the emptiness always occupies the most important place. Strange, isn't it? I think there used to be something there, but for all the power I have over dreams, I still can't find the answer as to what it was.

As for any other requests, it all depends on whether you have enough to offer in exchange. Just the rules of the ""business"" — you scratch my back, and I'll scratch yours. Also, smoking, drinking, and causing a ruckus are all strictly prohibited within the Boutique. That whole ""the customer is king"" concept doesn't fly here... And even when royalty does come into the shop, if they don't adhere to the rules, they'll find themselves being tossed out and kissing the pavement just like anyone else.",,,Fontaine

1929,Chiori,About Chiori: Directness,"Many have expressed displeasure both publicly and privately about my personality, and have complained that my words can be hurtful.

1930,Chiori,About Chiori: Brand Vision,"When I first started conceptualizing the idea of my brand, I reflected on many of my past experiences, and came up with a lot of phrases for the brand's slogan.

I promise I'll never criticize you for who you are. Hmm? Don't believe me? After all this time together, have you ever seen me not keep my word?",Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
1933,Chiori,About the Vision,"Because I was born in Inazuma, the people of Fontaine have dubbed me ""The Thundering Seamstress."" If that's what they want to call me, then that's what they can call me. I have no lingering affection for my homeland. After all, everything, including my Vision, only came to me after I decided to leave Inazuma.Oh, but that's not to say that I actively dislike those islands where fabric never fully dries. It's just that I haven't found any reason to go back.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
1934,Chiori,Something to Share,"When I was a kid, my parents would send me to a variety of activities to help expend my energy. One such activity was learning the art of the sword. But after some time, I suddenly felt that a dual wielding technique was really strong and impressive. It wasn't long before the instructor approached me and told me to stop practicing using that technique. When I asked him why, all he said was that it wasn't the standard sword technique, and that it was ""improper."" After that, I never attended his class again. Now that I think about it, it's fortunate that I insisted on following the way I preferred. Perhaps I'm just the sort who needs to keep both my hands busy.",,,Fontaine

1936,Chiori,About Navia,"She used to beg me to help her design all kinds of strange things. For example, little crowns for every handle on a ship's helm...

1937,Chiori,About Lyney,"I can't make a hat that could hide secrets, but it seems Lyney can enchant his hat to do just that... I'm a little curious about how it feels to wear a hat full of so many tricks and secrets like his. As for me, I don't need the burden of all that, it's easiest to just say what's on my mind.",Friendship Lv. 4,Lyney,Fontaine
1938,Chiori,About Lynette,"The magician's assistant sure doesn't say much, but I know she trusts me. You know, I sure get a lot of love from cats...",Friendship Lv. 4,Lynette,Fontaine
1939,Chiori,About Charlotte,"One time, Charlotte came into the shop, hoping to do an interview with me. I told her there was no point, because there was nothing new to talk about.

I've heard of journalists chasing leads, but now it seems news chases the journalists.",Friendship Lv. 4,Charlotte,Fontaine
1940,Chiori,About Chevreuse,"Working with Chevreuse and talking with her are a cinch. So easy, in fact, that whenever I say goodbye to her and return to tending to my customers again, it takes me a moment to shift gears mentally.",Friendship Lv. 4,Chevreuse,Fontaine
1941,Chiori,About Emilie,"Emilie's perfumes are very popular. We have a business agreement where I ask her to deliver small quantities of perfume she's working on to Chioriya Boutique. I let Eloffe secretly spray the perfume in the fitting room, and then I'll let her know any feedback I get from the customers. Even after all this time, I've never once had a customer ever say that my fitting room smelled strange. In fact, they usually come one after another to ask where they can buy the fragrance. Out of curiosity, I always buy a bottle when she brings them to sell in her shop. I have to say that such fragrances which can always bring a sense of refreshment are truly works of art.",Friendship Lv. 4,Emilie,Fontaine
1942,Chiori,About Wriothesley,"Yes. Some of my friends and partners have mentioned him to me before. I admire his skills at management and diplomacy, but I certainly have no intention of changing my way of doing things.",Friendship Lv. 4,Wriothesley,Fontaine
1943,Chiori,About Kirara,"While I was still in Inazuma, there was a cat with green eyes that always liked to follow me whenever I went out into the wild in search of inspiration. The kitty seemed to be very interested in the colors and patterns of the fabric I was carrying. She would even come up and rub her head against my legs when she was in a good mood.Later, I recognized those green eyes again, but on a girl with two tails. The way she gazed at new and intriguing things still had not changed after so many years.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kirara,Fontaine
1944,Chiori,About Kamisato Ayaka,"If I wasn't always slipping away to go play when I was a child, I probably would never have had the chance to meet the young lady of the Kamisato Clan. There was one time when I climbed my way into the Kamisato Clan's courtyard, and her Temari just happened to roll over towards the wall. I could tell that she was both surprised and happy to see me. We played together and chatted for quite some time, but I was discovered in the end. And so, our brief friendship came to an end as I was kicked off the premises.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kamisato Ayaka,Fontaine
1945,Chiori,More About Chiori: I,"I don't think my temper is as bad as people make it out to be. I just don't like wasting my time on trivial matters, that's all. But for some reason, it's always those trivial things that come back to haunt me. So, over time, I've ended up with a bad reputation. I would say that's completely unjust!",,,Fontaine
1946,Chiori,More About Chiori: II,"Ever since I was a kid, I've always had a problem with authority. There was a period when I hated the rules, and would always insist on going against the grain. Thanks to this headstrong character of mine, I've had to go through a lot of suffering. But eventually, I came to understand that rules aren't completely a bad thing. What I really can't stand is the feeling that I can't make decisions based on what I truly think.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Fontaine
1947,Chiori,More About Chiori: III,"When I was little, I used to always look forward to the summer festival in my hometown. Every year, people would take out the most vibrant and beautiful clothes, and carefully put them on before joining the crowd...Every time the festival came around, there'd be all of these brightly colored spheres hanging from people's belts, goldfish that you couldn't scoop up from the bowl no matter how hard you tried, apple candy so sweet that even the children couldn't finish them all, and fireworks so beautiful that they could have only come from the Naganohara house... I always had a lot of fun at such festivals, but even then, I would always feel like something was ""missing"" when I went home at the end of the night. It was only after I got much older that I realized I must have wanted to become more than just a spectator at such a wonderful event....It's just like how people will always associate the house of ""Naganohara"" with fireworks. I hope that one day, people will also associate festivals with Chioriya clothes.Hehe, just thinking about the prospect of that gets me really fired up. Alright, time to go back to the shop and churn out a few more designs.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
1948,Chiori,More About Chiori: IV,"Although I can get quite immersed in my work, I also enjoy living in the moment. When I have some free time, I would often pack some food and find a lovely place in nature to take a cozy midday nap, before returning home, relaxing some more, and then finally falling asleep to my favorite music. Oh, and other times, I like to go out for food with my friends, talk about everything that's happening in the world, and party until everyone's completely hammered. Honestly, it all just depends on what I feel like doing in the moment. Just as fashion only exists in the moment, I also love living in the moment. So, what do you think? Want to go out with me tonight and enjoy a whole night of fun?",Friendship Lv. 5,,Fontaine
1949,Chiori,More About Chiori: V,"I love Inazuma's petite desserts, as well as all culinary dishes subtle and light. Similarly, I also like the feel of my homeland's fabrics, as well as the practice of taking a bath after a long working day. But on the flip side, I also adore the soft waves of Fontaine's seas, as well as the beautiful scenery underneath the waters.Sometimes, I wonder if everything is in fact predestined, and if I'm still living in the shadow of my past. But then, another question always follows — would the answer to that really change anything? In any case, I'm still me, living in my present. Even if I'm only the way I am due to what has happened in my past, my future is still in my own hands, and no one in this world can really change that.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
1950,Chiori,Chiori's Hobbies,"I'm pursuing my dream through my work, and exploring the meaning of freedom through my art. What's the point of spending years and years of your life over something that's not near and dear to your heart?",,,Fontaine
1951,Chiori,Chiori's Troubles,"Sometimes, I worry that I haven't made as much progress as I'd hoped, and thus, it'd be hard to know when I would actually realize my dream of making Chioriya renowned throughout the world. Still, that's no reason to question or abandon the dream. Rather than worrying or doubting myself, my time would be better spent creating a few more designs.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
1952,Chiori,Favorite Food,"I can never forget the Inazuman desserts I used to indulge in as a child. But rather than the joy of tasting them, I've always been more interested in the process of making them. Had I been less drawn to the fascinating world of fabrics and color, the world would have gained another dessert chef.",,,Fontaine
1953,Chiori,Least Favorite Food,"I can't handle food with particularly strong flavors, like Haggis, for example. The experience of eating it is kind of like... suddenly getting hit with a faceful of Geo Specter out of nowhere. Does that make sense to you?",,,Fontaine
1954,Chiori,Receiving a Gift: I,"Mm, I do love this dish. Why don't you bring me some more next time. Don't worry, I'll also bring a gift for you in return.",,,Fontaine

1957,Chiori,Birthday,"Yeah, yeah... Happy birthday, or whatever. Just tell me if there's a gift you like — I can't be bothered to try and guess what you want. Hm? Too direct? Alright then, why don't you grab Navia, Kirara, and the others, and maybe a few of your friends as well. We can have a party tonight at my place. I'll take some notes on the gifts that the others have prepared for you, and make you an accessory right then and there. Ten thousand mora that you'd like it.

2122,Layla,More About Layla: V,"I've heard people say she thinks a ""blessing from the stars"" is the reason why all of her outstanding schoolwork gets magically finished while she's asleep. Ah, she has absolutely no idea. ...Oh, but seriously, don't tell her, okay?",Friendship Lv. 6,,Sumeru
2123,Layla,Layla's Hobbies...,"Drawing Star Charts is really tiring work... I really don't think I'd be able to keep at it if it wasn't something I'm interested in. You have to use a ruler, then do some calculations on paper, then check past Starlogs... Before you know it, the whole day is gone. But then when I look at the finished product, a huge, neatly drawn, accurate map of the stars... it always gives me a huge sense of accomplishment.",,,Sumeru

2126,Layla,Least Favorite Food,"Someone once told me about a mysterious merchant who was selling really effective Sleep Gummies. It cost all my scholarship money, plus all the other Mora I'd saved up, but I bought some. They worked great, and for a while I slept like a baby. But... they're 200 thousand Mora a box... I can't afford that... I—I can't let myself buy them ever again, nope, no way.

2142,Mika,When the Sun Is Out,The sun is out and visibility is excellent... Perfect conditions for observation. Couldn't ask for anything better!,,,Mondstadt
2143,Mika,When the Wind Is Blowing,Huh... Could this wind be a sign from the Anemo Archon? Or is it just a result of the terrain's effects on the atmosphere...,,,Mondstadt
2144,Mika,Good Morning,"Oh, good morning! ...I prepared the breakfast we usually eat in the expeditionary force. If you don't mind, maybe you could tell me our plan of action for today while you eat.",,,Mondstadt
2145,Mika,Good Afternoon,"Oh, please wait a moment, our meal's almost ready! Field ration no.3 — it's the Reconnaissance Company's favorite. I'll check the nearby area again shortly to see if there are any suitable places for a short rest.",,,Mondstadt

2148,Mika,About Mika: Work,"Hmm? What's a Front-Line Land Surveyor? Well, my duty is to scout ahead into unknown territory, survey the terrain, and identify key locations.

2150,Mika,About Us: Rumors,"Ah, sorry... I heard all about you when I first arrived back in Mondstadt. Super powerful people like you and Paimon usually have some kind of strict personal code.

But luckily, you two are really nice, and I have nothing to worry about!",,,Mondstadt
2151,Mika,About Us: Speaking in Code,"Some forward scouts will use the word ""Octave"" to indicate that they've run out of arrows and are returning to camp... Or ""Vera"" to mean ""the conditions are good, we should engage the enemy""... Hey, why don't we also come up with some code words? It'll come in handy, especially if we'll be working together long term. Go ahead, I'm good with any of your ideas!",Friendship Lv. 6,,Mondstadt
2152,Mika,About the Vision,"To be honest, even I was amazed that I managed to receive a Vision. It's really come in handy, but I shouldn't completely rely on its powers. Instead, I prefer to think of it as a sort of safeguard to use in case something happens. As a member of the Knights of Favonius, I should place more importance on team cooperation, and come up with ways to overcome difficulties together with my teammates.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
2153,Mika,Something to Share,"Here's a simple survey trick that you might find useful... Stretch out your arm, and raise your thumb towards the target area. Align your right eye's line of sight and your thumb to the left side of the target, and your left eye to the right side of the target, and multiply the distance between the two sides by the right multiplier... You can use this trick to estimate the height of a mountain and whether it's climbable, or the width of a river and whether you can swim across.",,,Mondstadt
2154,Mika,Interesting Things,"I heard Klee mention that there's a type of plant that can relay sound... if only we could somehow carry this plant with us in the field. That way, I could instantly report back about the terrain... I could even stay near the front lines and guide our rear forces to attack enemy targets from afar with volleys of arrows.",,,Mondstadt
2155,Mika,About Kaeya,"Before joining the Knights, I had to take a number of exams. Captain Kaeya was the main person in charge of all the testing.

I would get worried that I was not keeping up with his pace, and that I was letting him down...",Friendship Lv. 4,Kaeya,Mondstadt
2156,Mika,About Varka: Instruction,"Grand Master Varka is not only a strong leader who commands respect, but also my personal combat instructor. He taught me to think on my feet and avoid engaging enemies at close combat to make up for my small stature and relative lack of stamina. Following his advice, I learned how to fight with a polearm and crossbow, and I must say, this fighting style is far more suitable to me.",Friendship Lv. 4,Varka,Mondstadt
2157,Mika,About Varka: The Captain,"The Grand Master said that I need to set higher goals for myself, and strive to achieve them. I've always had that kind of attitude, but it wasn't until I was on the expedition that I realized how serious things can become... One day, I met the Fatui Harbinger known as The Captain. I can't even begin to imagine how I can deal with an opponent like him. I just... Such powerful people are really on a level of their own, I'm not even remotely close...",Friendship Lv. 6,Varka,Mondstadt
2158,Mika,About Jean,"The Deputy... I mean, the Acting Grand Master is a strong and considerate leader who always makes me feel at ease. She's always out there looking after all of us.

2159,Mika,About Amber,"Oh? Amber the Outrider? She's the most reliable vanguard, and has amazing reconnaissance skills! The roles of Front-Line Surveyors and the Outriders are similar given that we both operate ahead of the main force. Amber has a lot of experience, and I've learned a lot of survival skills from her, as well as how to better maintain my crossbow strings and arrows.",Friendship Lv. 4,Amber,Mondstadt
2160,Mika,About Eula: Tasks,"Captain Eula is a strong fighter with a combat style of her own, and she's always looked out for me. When I first joined the company, she assigned me a variety of tasks, way more than what other members had, and that quickly improved my ability to adapt. Once I grew accustomed to the way she expresses herself, I was able to work together with her just fine!",Friendship Lv. 4,Eula,Mondstadt
2161,Mika,About Eula: Daily Conduct,"Actually, I really admire Captain Eula. She is friendly and free-spirited, and her mental fortitude is out of this world.

2162,Mika,About Lisa,"Our librarian Lisa had always offered her help when I was first teaching myself how to draw maps.

2163,Mika,About Klee,"Oh? Klee? She's super cheerful, and I've heard that... she's as strong as the Grand Master himself. She's invited me to go on adventures with her before, and we always had a great time together! Although she would experiment with dangerous weapons from time to time, which means I've had to revise my maps on several occasions... But I still feel it's worth it!",Friendship Lv. 4,Klee,Mondstadt
2164,Mika,About Venti,"I really like that bard... He's a very talented performer, and his melodies always seem to make me feel at home. If I had to pick a tune that best represents Mondstadt, it'd definitely be one of his. It's too bad that I'm not often in the city, otherwise, I could bring him some gifts every day...",Friendship Lv. 4,Venti,Mondstadt
2165,Mika,About Albedo,"The Chief Alchemist has been very kind to me. He helped me make all the survey equipment I use in the field... I even have some pens he made that will work even when I'm hanging upside down from a tree. But it seems that making artistic sketches is quite different from making maps. I've tried to make some sketches of a target area as supplemental intel before, and word has it that Captain Albedo went silent for a long time when he saw them...",Friendship Lv. 4,Albedo,Mondstadt
2166,Mika,More About Mika: I,"Hmm? You want to know more about me? Well, I'm just an ordinary person, so I don't really have any interesting stories... I guess all I could talk about is my experiences, would you be willing to hear about that?",,,Mondstadt
2167,Mika,More About Mika: II,"Ever since I was a kid, I've wanted to become a cartographer, and map out every corner of Teyvat. It's only later on that I discovered the Knights of Favonius actually have that kind of role.

This job has let me live out my dreams, and it's already brought me lots of fulfillment.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Mondstadt
2168,Mika,More About Mika: III,"Everyone in the Knights of Favonius is really strong, and I feel like there's something I could learn from each member. After gaining new skills from everyone, I should also do my best to return the favor. So if there's anything the others need help with, then I'll do my best to make that happen.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
2169,Mika,More About Mika: IV,"It seems like... after I assisted the Grand Master and Captain Eula a few times with their errands, some members of our group have begun to see me as their official messenger. If I ever misspoke, it would cause trouble for our leaders, and the blame would be all mine. So, whenever I am around others I'm unfamiliar with, I often try to only comment on things I'm absolutely confident in, which makes everyone think I'm timid. But would you say this whole situation is just a sort of misunderstanding?",Friendship Lv. 5,,Mondstadt
2170,Mika,More About Mika: V,"You know, one good thing after coming back from the expedition is that I don't feel so worried anymore. As long as I'm not causing trouble for anyone else, then I don't really mind what anyone might think of me. The Knights of Favonius is like my second family, and I've got to master my work as a Front-Line Surveyor. My hard work can let everyone finish their tasks more smoothly and end their days with just that much less to worry about...",Friendship Lv. 6,,Mondstadt
2171,Mika,Mika's Hobbies,"Oh? My hobbies? ...I guess my favorite thing would be camping out in unknown territory. Just taking in the fresh scenery, making a cozy little camp, starting a bonfire and making some food. It really brings me happiness!",,,Mondstadt
2172,Mika,Mika's Troubles,"To be honest, I'm not too good at dealing with people I'm not familiar with. Maybe it's because I'm not really good at holding a conversation. Can you give me some pointers in that area?",,,Mondstadt
2173,Mika,Favorite Food,"The Grand Master said that a youngster like me needs to eat more meat, which will build more strength and physical stamina. Even though there's little chance I'll ever get really buff. I do like eating meat dishes. The others in the Reconnaissance Company seem to share this taste as well.",,,Mondstadt
2174,Mika,Least Favorite Food,"Unlike my brother, I can't stand the taste of alcohol. All it takes is one sip and I'd be out cold, and the others would have to go out of their way to take care of me. Even just the smell of a strong drink being opened is enough to make me dizzy.",,,Mondstadt
2175,Mika,Receiving a Gift: I,"Thanks so much... this is such a marvelous dish, I would feel terrible using it just to fill my stomach! Can I put it away for storage?",,,Mondstadt
2176,Mika,Receiving a Gift: II,The taste and portions are both incredible. You really went the extra mile for me.,,,Mondstadt

2196,Gorou,About Gorou: Top Dog,"Huh? ""Top Dog Gorou""? Where did you hear that? *sigh* To be honest, I've grown quite close with my fellow officers, and always share any good news I might have with them. In private, they've all started calling me Top Dog out of respect... But in terms of age, they are all my seniors.",,,Inazuma
2197,Gorou,About Gorou: Advice,"The troops seem to picture me as someone of extraordinary abilities — I think it might be because of our streak of victories lately. Now they always come to me for advice on even the most trivial matters. When I see the expectant look in their eyes, it's impossible for me to turn them away, but at the same time, my strategic ability is limited... All I can do is give some general pointers, or failing that, respond based on my gut feeling alone. *sigh* I just hope I'm not letting them down.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2198,Gorou,About Us: Speaking Your Mind,"If there's anything ever troubling you, don't keep it all muzzled up inside. You can always speak your mind with me!

Whatever it is, I'm all ears.",,,Inazuma
2199,Gorou,About Us: Camaraderie,"We train together, eat together, and relax together. There's no better way to strengthen communication and build tacit understanding between everyone on the team.

Well, I mean, that's how the troops and I have been bonding as a team.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
2200,Gorou,About the Vision,"My Vision amplifies my abilities in battle. It allows me to take greater responsibility on the battlefield and forge a way forward for the troops. But I also understand that one person alone, no matter how strong, is never enough to turn the tide of a battle. The key to victory is everyone's united effort, fighting for a common cause.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2201,Gorou,Something to Share: Dressed for Battle,"I don't like to enter battle wearing lots of heavy equipment. I travel light, that's my style. My strength is in moving quickly around the battlefield, seeking out opportunities to take control of the fight. I always target the strongest warriors first to weaken the enemy's morale.",,,Inazuma
2202,Gorou,Something to Share: Ever-Victorious General,"The troops have come up with a nickname for me, the ""ever-victorious pointy-eared general."" Now there's even a rumor going around saying that ""if you want Top Dog Gorou's victorious luck, give his pointy ears a rub."" Grrr, there will be no rubbing of my ears, and that's final.

2204,Gorou,About Beidou,"Captain Beidou values camaraderie, and her exceptional abilities command respect. She once said that she prefers to avoid involving her companions in disputes that don't concern them, which I can completely understand. That's why I only request her help when we have no one else to turn to.",Friendship Lv. 4,Beidou,Inazuma
2205,Gorou,About Kaedehara Kazuha,"I've seen all kinds of wandering samurai before, and Kazuha is categorically a different breed from the others. He's like a gust of wind that sweeps through the land. Though he never stays for long, he is always able to contribute something to those who are around him. When I fought alongside him, I learned more about what it means to be truly carefree and without constraints. In any case, I think that Kazuha and I make a great team together!",Friendship Lv. 4,Kaedehara Kazuha,Inazuma
2206,Gorou,About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Duties,"As the leader of Watatsumi Island, Her Excellency is responsible for assessing the scenario and formulating a plan.

We are united with the whole resistance in achieving a single purpose: victory.",Friendship Lv. 4,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Inazuma
2207,Gorou,About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Attitude,"I have only the utmost respect for Her Excellency. Without her ingenious and insightful strategies, the resistance could never have come as far as it has today. But if you ask me, it seems that deep down she prefers a much quieter existence. So when there's no pressing military matters, I try not to disturb her too much.",Friendship Lv. 4,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Inazuma
2208,Gorou,About the Raiden Shogun,"Grr, the Raiden Shogun... I could never bring myself to accept her past actions, no matter what her reasoning may have been. Though a peace treaty has been signed between Watatsumi Island and the Shogunate, I refuse to let my guard down. If conflict ever breaks out again, I will resume my place back on the front line.",Friendship Lv. 4; Omnipresence Over Mortals,Raiden Shogun,Inazuma
2209,Gorou,About Kujou Sara,"I have nothing good to say about the Shogun's Army, but Kujou Sara is perhaps the most honorable officer among their ranks. We've met each other countless times in battle, emerging both victorious and defeated at different times. *sigh* I know now that it's not realistic to think this way, but I did use to wonder what things would be like if those like her could value the wishes of the people and be free from the grip of the Shogunate.","Friendship Lv. 4; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",Kujou Sara,Inazuma
2210,Gorou,About Yae Miko,"Oh, her... I'd prefer not to talk about her. Can we change the topic? Or, if there are any tasks I can take off your hand, I'll gladly oblige! Anything at all? ...Ahem, let's just say it'd be best for my general well-being if we can we avoid talking about her...",Friendship Lv. 4,Yae Miko,Inazuma
2211,Gorou,About Kamisato Ayaka,"The Yashiro Commission operates as part of the Shogunate, but on many issues they tend to side with the people of Inazuma. In fact, the Shirasagi Himegimi has managed to establish an excellent reputation for herself, despite facing pressure from both sides. I suppose she must know how to keep her composure at all times and navigate sensitive situations tactfully... There's much I could learn from her.","Friendship Lv. 4; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",Kamisato Ayaka,Inazuma
2212,Gorou,About Sayu,"Hmm, according to our intel, she is a ninja proficient in the art of infiltration — a skill set which could prove very useful in some of Her Excellency's special operations... However, our intel also indicates that she could be difficult to recruit as she is rather unruly, and often disappears without a trace. Hmm? She's with the Yashiro Commission? Oh, well forget it then.",Friendship Lv. 4,Sayu,Inazuma
2213,Gorou,About Shikanoin Heizou,"You mean that sneaky detective that never seems to actually be working on a case? Well, no one from the Shogunate can be fully trusted, so I'll be keeping my eyes and ears on him! On a separate note, he does have some talent for investigation. But how can we know that this isn't all part of some nefarious scheme? Hmm. Only time will tell, I suppose.",Friendship Lv. 4,Shikanoin Heizou,Inazuma
2214,Gorou,More About Gorou: I,"Hmm, I'm afraid that most of my days have been spent on the battlefield, so there's not much to tell about me. But if you'd really like to hear my stories, I'm happy to sit down and tell you everything!",,,Inazuma
2215,Gorou,More About Gorou: II,"I may not have superior cunning or intelligence, but what I do have is my own two hands and my life to lay on the line. Countless battles in, I'm still here, so I guess these hands and my will to survive were both strong enough to see me through. Some even say that no matter how dire the battle may be, everyone will emerge unscathed as long as they follow me. And with that, I've somehow gained enough reputation among our forces to become the leader that I am now.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Inazuma
2216,Gorou,More About Gorou: III,"At first, our only enemies were roaming bandits, pirates, and monsters. But then, everything changed when the Raiden Shogun enacted the Vision Hunt Decree. The Shogun's Army marched up expecting to put us in our place, but we were ready for them, and we hit them hard. Hehe, I bet they never expected to meet such fierce resistance.","Friendship Lv. 4; Stillness, the Sublimation of Shadow",,Inazuma
2217,Gorou,More About Gorou: IV,"Her Excellency once warned me of my fatal flaw... I tend to get too engrossed in battle, fighting deep into enemy lines and forgetting about everything else. She told me that my bravery is commendable, but as a ranking officer, it's not my place to do this. I'm doing my best to improve, but... Would you also be able to keep an eye on me?",Friendship Lv. 5,,Inazuma
2218,Gorou,More About Gorou: V,"We are not fighting against any particular group or faction. No, we fight against a destructive malice — a malice that has trampled the aspirations of the people and destroyed the peaceful lives they once knew. After I rid the land of such evil I will be able to peacefully lay down my weapon. Only then will I trade my uniform for civilian attire... and finally stroll the beautiful landscape of Watatsumi Island together with you.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
2219,Gorou,Gorou's Hobbies,"I love mountain climbing! The steeper, the better. Climbing trains my body and mind, making me stronger with every grip and every foothold.

2221,Gorou,Favorite Food,"My favorites are cake and Tricolor Dango, probably because I seldom get the chance to enjoy the luxury of sweets. The rations we have in the field are intended to be simple, effective, and quick, and are seldom served with any seasonings at all, let alone sugar... It's probably the most precious commodity of all. Ah, what can I say — I guess I just have a sweet tooth!",,,Inazuma
2222,Gorou,Least Favorite Food,"I'll pretty much eat anything, but onions are an exception. One time, the logistics division added ground onion to my food and I bawled in front of everyone, right there at the mess table... *sigh* Talk about embarrassing.

2242,Yun Jin,About Yun Jin: Schooling,"My schooling started very early. In fact, my earliest memories are of my father teaching me to read. Despite my best efforts, my ability is not half of his. Enough to write operas, but compared to his level of erudition, I still have much to strive for.",,,Liyue
2243,Yun Jin,About Yun Jin: Opera Training,"In her youth, my mother was a famous opera singer in Liyue Harbor, and I learned all the operas I know from her. But, you could never imagine how strict she was with me as a teacher. Thinking back on it now, I... *sigh* No, no, no, I'd rather not think about it at all.",,,Liyue
2244,Yun Jin,About Us: Opera Troupe,"We have some grand performances coming up soon, and it just so happens that we have an opening for someone to play the part of a skilled swordfighter.

2246,Yun Jin,About the Vision,"Hmm? My Vision? Hehe, I suppose the Lord of Geo must be a fan of the opera. Perhaps the old man was so delighted with my performance that he decided to grant me a Vision.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
2247,Yun Jin,Something to Share: Drinks,"One of my absolute favorite pastimes is trying out all kinds of new beverages. I've already tried all the sophisticated-sounding drinks that previous generations came up with — you know, like Pine Nectar Tea and Snow Blossom Tea. I'm beginning to worry that I'll run out of new drinks to try soon. You don't happen to have any recommendations, do you?",,,Liyue
2248,Yun Jin,Something to Share: Dreams,"Sometimes, I just feel like casting off my opera costume and going traveling overseas. You know, to explore the outside world. For now, I'll need to keep working hard at what I'm doing, so someday that dream can come true.",,,Liyue
2249,Yun Jin,Interesting Things,The chirping of the songbirds at daybreak always puts me in the best of moods.,,,Liyue
2250,Yun Jin,About Xinyan,"The elders of the troupe are always harping on about rock 'n' roll being a bad influence. Needless to say, they never approve of me going to see Xinyan's shows. ""It's for your own good,"" they say. Hmph, all it's really about is their inability to accept anything new. Whatever, those old fogies can't tell me what to do. I'm going to keep rocking out at Xinyan's gigs, every week, and that's that.",Friendship Lv. 4,Xinyan,Liyue
2251,Yun Jin,About Hu Tao,"Ah yes, Hu Tao. Very expressive face, and she has a sharp mind too — you can be discussing the most mundane thing in the world, and she'll always bring out a string of witty remarks. I admire her a lot. There's never a dull moment when you have friends like her around.",Friendship Lv. 4,Hu Tao,Liyue
2252,Yun Jin,About Zhongli,"The customs of the opera are very particular, and are passed down from generation to generation. Sometimes I find that I only know the hows but not the whys behind what we do. But when speaking with Zhongli, it is abundantly evident that he knows the origins behind almost everything. Who wouldn't be delighted to have such a connoisseur in their audience?",Friendship Lv. 4,Zhongli,Liyue
2253,Yun Jin,About Ningguang,The Tianquan is a big spender and has made several very generous donations to our troupe. I can only return her generosity by delivering my best possible performance.,Friendship Lv. 4,Ningguang,Liyue
2254,Yun Jin,About Xingqiu,"Oh, so you are also acquainted with Xingqiu? Haha, he is quite the clever one, and with a sharp wit as well. The moment you let your guard down, you're at risk of becoming the butt of one of his practical jokes... Don't say I didn't warn you.",Friendship Lv. 4,Xingqiu,Liyue
2255,Yun Jin,About Shenhe,"I have long since known ""The Divine Damsel of Devastation"" inside out, back to front, but it was only very recently that I learned that the ""divine damsel"" in question is actually a real person. Life is full of strange twists sometimes! My only hope is that she can find true friendship and never be lonely again.",Friendship Lv. 4; The Crane Returns on the Wind,Shenhe,Liyue
2256,Yun Jin,About Keqing,"I have yet to see the Yuheng ever attend an opera performance. Now that I think about it, whenever I happen to see her out on the street, she always seems to be in a great hurry.",Friendship Lv. 4,Keqing,Liyue
2257,Yun Jin,About Kaedehara Kazuha,"Kaedehara Kazuha is among the many outlanders who enjoy Liyue opera. Whether it's an orchestral section or a percussive piece, he always sits there and listens quietly. Talk about great manners!",Friendship Lv. 4,Kaedehara Kazuha,Liyue
2258,Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: I,Many of the operas we've been performing recently are new ones that I wrote after assuming the directorship of the troupe. I suppose the fact that I can both write and sing my own material has contributed to my rising popularity in Liyue Harbor.,,,Liyue
2259,Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: II,"Per the tradition, actors must wrap their hair, put on full-face makeup and an elaborate costume, and make all sorts of other preparations before they take the stage. There's no doubt that an opera star in full attire looks spectacular, but achieving this look is frightfully exhausting. So I perform without hair and makeup whenever I have the option — and if I must perform in full dress, I try to select a costume that isn't too heavy. Fortunately, the good folks at Heyu Tea House are quite lenient with us. Otherwise, we'd be working ourselves to early graves.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Liyue
2260,Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: III,"At the start of my opera career, I have to say I did let the standing ovations from our audiences go to my head a little. It wasn't long before I developed a captious attitude... If I didn't like the script, or if the stage was too small, or if I thought there weren't enough people in the audience, I would refuse to perform. Looking back now, it was all terribly arrogant of me... my goodness. I shall never let myself become so vain again.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
2261,Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: IV,"Now that I think about it, the Yun-Han Opera Troupe has been under my leadership for quite some time now. Before taking it over, I only knew two things: how to write opera and how to perform it on stage. I never gave any thought to how to run a troupe. Becoming the troupe's director gave me a crash course in this unfamiliar area and I've experienced all the highs and lows of working with people along the way... Only now do I understand that life mirrors opera, just as opera reflects life.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Liyue
2262,Yun Jin,More About Yun Jin: V,"Well you know, many of Liyue's legends are centered around stories of gods and the adepti, so most operas focus on the supernatural, too. A prime example would be ""The Divine Damsel of Devastation,"" which we have been performing recently. Long-time opera fans adore this sort of material, but in this age of humanity, I would rather like to tell stories about ordinary people. Yes, how grand it would be to sing about the hopes and dreams of ordinary people for all to hear. I've never shared these thoughts with anyone before... Thank you for listening so patiently. I'm fortunate to have a close friend like you.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Liyue

2265,Yun Jin,Favorite Food,"Tianshu Meat, Black-Back Perch Stew, Cured Pork Dry Hotpot... Oh, I just want them all!  Unfortunately, I basically never get to eat such things, but... um, if you don't mind me asking... Can you cook any of those dishes?",,,Liyue

2270,Yun Jin,Birthday,"Oh, so today's your birthday? Well, I wouldn't know how to throw you a feast if I tried... so how about I sing you a song? For you alone, an audience of one. So... what song would you like to hear me sing? The choice is yours.",,,Liyue

2288,Freminet,About Freminet: Diving,"As you know, diving is one of the few things I'm any good at. I spend more time among the Tidalga than I do talking to people.

2299,Freminet,About Lyney: Mask,"Lyney is our team leader, and acts like everyone's older brother... But I can tell that he puts on a brave face sometimes.

2303,Freminet,About Furina: Verdict,"...Okay fine. I've seen what the Hydro Archon's like when she's sitting in the audience. In my view, she's a very charismatic speaker, but it's her silences that intrigue me more. Her eyes... they're like the darkness at the bottom of the ocean.

2340,Lisa,About the Vision,"Visions? Ah, they're a necessary device in controlling the elements — with you being the sole exception, of course. Hmm... As for why that is, perhaps... we can find the time to experiment a little?",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt

2348,Lisa,About Klee,"Last time little Klee wanted to use my workshop for her experiments, I had to say no, and she was angry at me for the rest of the day. *sigh* What happened the next day, you ask? She went off happily to play outside of course.",Friendship Lv. 4,Klee,Mondstadt
2349,Lisa,About Mona,"As for Mona? She seems to be an excellent mage, but I'm not a part of their Hexenzirkel. The idea of Irminsul exploration and formal tea parties just leaves me cold.",Friendship Lv. 4,Mona,Mondstadt

2351,Lisa,About Fischl,"Fischl, yes, she's always in the library looking to borrow fantasy novels. She always returns her books three days early and looks after them very well. She's a good kid.",Friendship Lv. 4,Fischl,Mondstadt
2352,Lisa,About Noelle,"Every time I ask Noelle to dust off the bookshelves, I'm always left with the sense that the more exhausted I make her, the happier she becomes. Yes, who knows what's going on with her... *chuckles*",Friendship Lv. 4,Noelle,Mondstadt
2353,Lisa,About Sucrose,"Try not to bother Sucrose if you're at a loose end, you'll only startle the poor girl. She's gifted at interacting with all sorts of exotic creatures — just hopeless when it comes to humans.",Friendship Lv. 4,Sucrose,Mondstadt
2354,Lisa,About Cyno,"I've barely kept in touch with anyone from the Akademiya since leaving Sumeru, except for the occasional letters to my teachers out of basic courtesy. Fortunately, not every promising student turned out as lazy as I am... I heard that one of my juniors, Cyno, now leads quite the action-packed life.",Friendship Lv. 4,Cyno,Mondstadt
2355,Lisa,About Collei,"Ah, dear little Collei. Every time she writes to me, she tries out new words and expressions she's learned recently... Hehe, no wonder she's improving so quickly. That wonderful and warmhearted master of hers must have helped a lot too.",Friendship Lv. 4,Collei,Mondstadt
2356,Lisa,About Mika,"I do rather envy Huffman for having such a caring little brother. Mika takes care of everything around the house and even looks after him when he's drunk... Ah, how nice it must be to lounge around all day without a care in the world... Hmm? What do you mean, I already do that? You're getting quite bold these days, aren't you, cutie?",Friendship Lv. 4,Mika,Mondstadt
2357,Lisa,More About Lisa: I,"So, which element would you like to learn about today?",,,Mondstadt

2359,Lisa,More About Lisa: III,"When I taught Razor how to utilize Elemental Energy, I never expected him to master the technique so quickly. Come to think of it, you're talented too. Maybe I could teach you a few tricks...",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
2360,Lisa,More About Lisa: IV,"What's that? You want to learn some Sumeru Akademiya magic? I'm afraid it might too much for you to handle right now... Hmm, though I suppose it can't hurt to teach you some of the basics. Here, start by reading the beginner's guide, it's only 800 pages or so.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Mondstadt
2361,Lisa,More About Lisa: V,"A Vision may seem like a great tool, but one day, the power one accumulates always finds a way to turn back on you. Should such a day come for me, so long as you're around... Ah, never mind.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Mondstadt
2362,Lisa,Lisa's Hobbies,"Hey darling, would you like to try one of my magic potions? There's no knowing what it will do to you until you try it, though... Don't say I didn't warn you!",,,Mondstadt
2363,Lisa,Lisa's Troubles,The interrogation room upstairs has sat there unused for two years now... It would be a much more lively place if Hertha would agree to let me use it as my private workshop... *sigh* She's such a spoilsport.,,,Mondstadt
2364,Lisa,Favorite Food,"I like making my own vegetable soup. I put a big bunch of vegetables into a cauldron and stir it with a long spoon. What does it taste like? Here, why don't you try it for yourself. Open wide!",,,Mondstadt
2365,Lisa,Least Favorite Food,"I suffer from extreme pumpkinphobia. The fall harvest is a difficult time of year for me, as you can imagine. I wonder if it would be worth the trouble to make all the pumpkins in the world disappear...",,,Mondstadt

2373,Lisa,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"I've already tried to persuade you every way possible... *sigh* Have it your way, cutie. I can no longer go on pretending at this point - Even a Hilichurl would see through the act. So be it, let me introduce you to the true Witch of Purple Rose.",Ascension Phase 6,,Mondstadt
2374,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Hello,"I am Sangonomiya Kokomi, the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island. My journey with you will be an opportunity to unwind... Ahem, I mean... to survey beyond our borders. Don't worry, I've left behind ample directives in my absence, and have also completed the island's projected development plans. Departing for a brief period will be of little consequence.",,,Inazuma

2385,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Good Night,Good night. Garner your strength for the battles ahead.,,,Inazuma
2386,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Directives,"The battlefield is unpredictable — one false move could mark utter defeat. Before the onset of battle, I bring every possible scenario into consideration, and turn my thoughts into written directives. These are then issued to the troops. ...It does seem at present like they're somewhat over-reliant on the directives, which worries me... If they read up on military strategy themselves, they could begin to rely on their own ability to read the battlefield. I need them to be able to identify and seize opportunities in the heat of the moment.",,,Inazuma
2387,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Sangonomiya Kokomi: Relaxing,"Mm... I hope we can put an end to this battle quickly. The Yae Publishing House has just released a new volume of ""A Legend of Sword."" Ah, I'd like nothing more than to curl up with a copy in my room and read it front to back.",,,Inazuma
2388,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Us: Experience,"My mother once taught me that it takes a broad outlook to become a qualified leader. However, my younger years were mostly spent traveling between Sangonomiya and the army. I never had time to embark on my own adventure. So... there are many aspects of adventuring that I've yet to fully understand. Mm, you'll have to excuse my lack of experience in this area.",,,Inazuma
2389,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Us: Confusion,"It's said that the depths of a person's heart run deep indeed. Yet, as the Divine Priestess of Watatsumi Island, it is my duty to strive to understand each person's thoughts. Let's start with you, Traveler. What are you thinking about now? Let me take a guess...",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
2390,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About the Vision,"In my book, Visions are symbols of aspiration, and aspiration is a precious thing indeed. This is exactly why the resistance was formed — to oppose the Vision Hunt Decree. Aspiration should never be abandoned or forcibly taken away.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2391,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Anything To Share: Periodicals,"Among Yae Publishing House's various publications, my personal favorite is the Teyvat Art of War. See, it has articles on classic military campaigns, as well as detailed analysis and commentary from famous strategists. There are a few that I particularly enjoy... Here, let me read them to you.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2392,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Anything To Share: Diving,"The world below water is not bright and sunny like that of dry land.

2393,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Interesting Things,"I simply love Watatsumi Sango Pearls... They're not just a source of income for Watatsumi Island, but a gift from the sea itself.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2394,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Gorou,"Gorou is an exceptional general... sincere, determined, and courageous. He has a strong camaraderie with the troops and is able to come up with creative battle plans. He does, however, have one shortcoming... He often lets the excitement of battle get to his head. If you are ever deployed to the battlefield together, be sure to have a good rein on him when things get underway.",Friendship Lv. 4,Gorou,Inazuma
2395,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Kujou Sara,"Mmm... I must admit, Kujou Sara is an opponent that cannot be taken lightly. She seldom employs cunning strategy, but her performance in open warfare is always admirable. The Shogun's Army places great trust in her abilities — they are united and ready to fight valiantly under her command, even to the death. Her forces have been a serious threat to the resistance on multiple occasions.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kujou Sara,Inazuma
2396,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Yae Miko,"I have also heard of Guuji Yae's great deeds. In all fairness, I hold her to be an outstanding shrine maiden, and she has performed her duties marvelously. I even heard that she holds responsibility where Yae Publishing House's light novels are concerned. An enigmatic individual to say the least...",Friendship Lv. 4,Yae Miko,Inazuma
2397,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Raiden Shogun,"Now that the Vision Hunt Decree is over, Watatsumi Island has once again returned to normal life. It has never been my intent to scrutinize the rights and wrongs of the Shogun's actions, even to this day. What I do care about is the future of our island. It is my hope that the Shogun will fulfill her promise and that we can live with the Shogunate in peace. However, if there comes a day when she once again casts aside the aspirations of the people, I can assure you that we won't sit by and watch.",Friendship Lv. 4; Omnipresence Over Mortals,Raiden Shogun,Inazuma
2398,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Beidou,"Ah... back when Beidou and I were carrying out ambushes against the Shogun's Army together, I raised my concerns that the enemy might detect our approach. But Beidou assured me of her fleet's unwavering discipline, and that raids could be carried out without detection. In the end, she was right, and that's exactly what happened. Now, every time the Watatsumi fleet encounters some sort of bottleneck, I consider inviting her to come and give them her instruction. There's no doubt, she runs a tight ship...",Friendship Lv. 4; Omnipresence Over Mortals,Beidou,Inazuma
2399,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Kaedehara Kazuha,"Kazuha once came and bunked with the resistance for a time. If I'm not mistaken, he got along very well with Gorou — they would often fight side-by-side in battle. Kazuha has a carefree personality and doesn't like constraints, but he would follow every command to the letter when he was among our ranks. In my opinion, not only is he an outstanding swordsman, but a very refined character.",Friendship Lv. 4; Omnipresence Over Mortals,Kaedehara Kazuha,Inazuma
2400,Sangonomiya Kokomi,About Shikanoin Heizou,"Initially, I was astonished to see anyone coming to Watatsumi Island wearing a Tenryou Commission uniform. A Tenryou Commission samurai would never be that brazen, and a Tenryou Commission spy would never be that conspicuous. Shortly after, I discovered that he was a self-proclaimed ""detective"" by the name of Shikanoin, and that he took no interest in military, government, or commercial affairs. Instead, he seemed to have arrived for a bit of sightseeing. As such, I set a few eyes on him, but refrained from taking any action to remove him from the island. Be sure to talk to him if the chance ever presents itself.",Friendship Lv. 4,Shikanoin Heizou,Inazuma
2401,Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: I,"No matter how pressing the situation may become, I must remain composed. If I let the stress get to me, then what can I expect from others around me?",,,Inazuma
2402,Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: II,"Legend has it that our ancestors lived in a palace in the depths of the ocean, and that the god, Orobashi, brought us to the surface. I've often wondered, wouldn't a palace like that be too dark? Every time I think about it, I start to really appreciate the light...",Friendship Lv. 3,,Inazuma
2403,Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: III,"After you left, the soldiers of Swordfish II nominated a temporary captain, but everyone was hoping that you'd return. I could only tell them that you'd been tasked with an important solo mission. If you get the chance, you should go visit them, I'm sure they'd love to see you.",Friendship Lv. 4; Omnipresence Over Mortals,,Inazuma
2404,Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: IV,"A long time ago, I had no intention of becoming the Divine Priestess. My only goal was to study military strategy and become an adviser. That way, I could remain behind the scenes and lessen my overall burden. *sigh* Fate had other ideas in store... You can't defy that which flows in your veins.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Inazuma
2405,Sangonomiya Kokomi,More About Sangonomiya Kokomi: V,"After becoming the Divine Priestess, I gradually grew accustomed to this life. At the very least, I have the power to change something when it doesn't sit well with me. More importantly, this title allowed me to meet you, did it not?",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
2406,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Sangonomiya Kokomi's Hobbies,"Huh? What do I enjoy? Simple. I like to find a quiet place by myself and read books on strategy... Ahh, the whole day without interruption. I'd be even happier if we looked over some of it together... One thing though... You'd have to sleep on the floor.",,,Inazuma
2407,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Sangonomiya Kokomi's Troubles,"To be quite honest, I'm not particularly skilled at communicating with others. Putting on my ""Divine Priestess airs"" certainly makes things easier, but once I run out of energy, I start to get a bit negative. I prevent others from seeing that side of me at all costs. The people of Watatsumi Island need a perfect leader, not some girl who likes to wile away her time at home.",Warriors' Dreams Like Spring Grass Renewing,,Inazuma
2408,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Favorite Food,"I just love eating Bird Egg Sushi. The ingredients are easy to find, and it's simple to prepare... Ah... perfect for military life. Sitting down to eat Bird Egg Sushi in the midst of war might seem a bit extravagant, but in most cases, simple food like this brings great satisfaction to the soldiers.",,,Inazuma
2409,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Least Favorite Food,"Mm... If I had to say, I'm not fond of any sort of seafood. But please, keep this strictly confidential. The fishing industry is essential to Watatsumi Island, and if word were to get out that seafood wasn't my thing, I'm afraid morale would be gravely affected.",,,Inazuma
2410,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Receiving a Gift: I,"Yummy, this is delicious! And it seems my energy is also... Ahem, I mean... Never mind...",,,Inazuma
2411,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Receiving a Gift: II,"I like to take my time and eat slowly, that way I can enjoy it for longer.",,,Inazuma
2412,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Receiving a Gift: III,"Oh, it seems we're at an impasse.",,,Inazuma
2413,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Birthday,"Happy birthday! So, what are your plans for the day? Oh, why don't we celebrate on Watatsumi Island? First, I'll take you out at daybreak to see the sunrise, then we can go diving during the heat of the day. In the evening, we can go for a stroll around Sangonomiya Shrine. If it rains, we'll find somewhere cozy to hide out with a few strategy books, and try to bake a cake together! In any case, no need to plan anything, the grand strategist has everything thought out for you!",,,Inazuma
2414,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Feelings About Ascension: Intro,Brute force is not my modus operandi. But becoming stronger isn't a bad thing.,Ascension Phase 1,,Inazuma
2415,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up,I'm just bubbling with energy... We'll make a formidable force in our next fight.,Ascension Phase 2,,Inazuma
2416,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Feelings About Ascension: Climax,"The moon shines bright over the depths of the seas as the tides come and go. It seems that as I go from strength to strength, so does my state of mind flow.",Ascension Phase 4,,Inazuma
2417,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"I often used to succumb to self-doubt. I would think to myself, ""Can a person like me really hold the title of Divine Priestess?"" Now, the thought hardly crosses my mind. When I'm with you, I seem to be able to cut straight through most problems.",Ascension Phase 6,,Inazuma
2418,Charlotte,Hello,"Hi there! I'm Charlotte, a journalist with The Steambird. It's a pleasure to meet you. If you've got time, would you be open to doing an exclusive interview? My journalistic instincts tell me that there's a treasure trove of news in you just bursting to get out!",,,Fontaine
2419,Charlotte,Chat: News,"If you keep your eyes peeled and your mind engaged, you'll find there's always a news story nearby just waiting to be discovered.",,,Fontaine

2433,Charlotte,About Us: Headliners,"Good news — I've convinced Euphrasie to make you the next headliners of The Steambird! You'll be right up there on the front cover, there'll be a whole feature about you that I wrote myself, and— Huh? What do you mean, ""no need""? C'mon, I've been pushing Euphrasie for ages on this! Can't you reconsider? I'll make it up to you, I promise! I'll treat you to a huge meal, pleeease?",Friendship Lv. 6; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,,Fontaine
2434,Charlotte,About the Vision,"To be honest... I'd prefer to have an Anemo Vision. Being able to fly around freely would make getting to interviews sooo much easier! A Cryo Vision's not too bad, though. At least I don't need to worry about my Kamera overheating.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
2435,Charlotte,Something to Share,"""Your credible source of the unbelievable truth!"" That's my journalistic motto. Hmm? ...Haha, yep, exactly — ""credible"" and ""incredible"" at the same time! What's that? ...Oh, if I had to choose, then obviously being credible is much more important! But most readers would sooner pay money for sensational stories than mundane facts... So we have to focus on the most incredible true stories to keep our readers engaged.",,,Fontaine
2436,Charlotte,Interesting Things,"Allow me to introduce the one and only Monsieur Verite. He's not just any Kamera — he's my trusty companion and assistant. See his little hat and bow tie? I had those custom made by Chiori. Pretty neat, huh? I've got loads of other outfits for him too, all in different styles. He comes dressed to impress for every interview, whatever the occasion!",,,Fontaine
2437,Charlotte,About Navia,"Now that her father's name's been cleared, and the case of the serial disappearances of young women is resolved, I guess Navia must be able to finally breathe a little easier. I don't know why, but somehow, she's found herself at the epicenter of all sorts of bad news lately... Luckily for her, I've been snatching up all the articles that mention her and doing whatever damage control I can before they get published. Heh, and uh... then getting told off constantly by Euphrasie for interfering... But y'know, I think Navia deserves a break, so I'm happy to take one for the team. Also, she agreed to do an in-depth exclusive interview, which definitely sweetens the deal!",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,Navia,Fontaine
2438,Charlotte,About Lyney,"Surprise, surprise — Lyney refused an interview with me once again. Do you know how many times that is now? ...Uh, actually, I've lost count. But never mind! Evading me only further confirms my suspicion that he's hiding the news story of a lifetime! As long as I keep digging, I'll find it — and when I do, it will shake the world like no other news report in history!",Friendship Lv. 4,Lyney,Fontaine
2439,Charlotte,About Lynette,"No matter what question you pose to her, Lynette just calmly lowers her eyes with an expressionless look on her face. It's like she's some sort of... clockwork doll. I'm really tempted to write an article titled something like: ""The Genius Magician's Puppet Assistant: Magic's Best-Kept Secret""... but I have a sneaking suspicion that even that wouldn't get a reaction out of her.",Friendship Lv. 4,Lynette,Fontaine
2440,Charlotte,About Clorinde,"Clorinde is the most well-known Champion Duelist in Fontaine, but she's also the most mysterious. I have a source who tells me that she uses some sort of mystical ritual to keep her weapon as good as new... Could this be the secret behind her famously undefeated track record in the Duelists' Ring? Ah, I'd love to spring that question on her one day... but I don't think I'll get the chance. She's publicly stated that she doesn't accept interviews.",Friendship Lv. 4,Clorinde,Fontaine
2441,Charlotte,About Wriothesley,"So... Did you get to meet the Duke in person? Yeah? Any nuggets of information that I should know about? Never mind the Credit Coupons, the Coupon Cafeteria, ""If a man will not work, he shall not eat""... That's all just generic filler. I'm talking about personal anecdotes about the man of Meropide himself... What do you mean, ""confidentiality""? Aw, not you, too! We had a deal! That does it — remember that gigantic feast I treated you to? I want my money back! Get your butts back to prison and do your time, you swindlers, you!",Friendship Lv. 4; Cataclysm's Quickening,Wriothesley,Fontaine
2442,Charlotte,About Emilie,"Emilie makes the best perfume in the whole Court of Fontaine. She introduced me to this amazing one the other day that works as an insect repellent, anti-perspirant, and deodorant all in one! It's a total life-saver for someone like me who spends so much time zooming around all over the place. I actually sprayed some on my wrist today... Go on, take a whiff, it's heavenly!",Friendship Lv. 4,Emilie,Fontaine
2443,Charlotte,About Chiori,"I did a little snooping around at Chioriya Boutique once. Aside from the wealthy housewives of Fontaine and the box-ticking tourists from overseas, some of the regular customers there look like really rough characters! Big muscly types with scars on their face, guys in masks and hats with their swords drawn... But they always come bearing gifts and acting like humble servants. Uh... Well, mostly. Anyone with a bad attitude is literally sent flying back out the door. Seriously! I snapped a photo of a guy being thrown out once, he was like four feet in the air!",Friendship Lv. 4,Chiori,Fontaine
2444,Charlotte,About Freminet,"I've met Freminet a few times since being introduced. He quickly took an interest in Monsieur Verite — that's my Kamera-slash-assistant — and even made a few improvements to my lenses. I gotta say, though, my heart was in my mouth watching him completely dismantle Monsieur Verite in a matter of seconds... Amazing he managed to reassemble it just as swiftly. He seems very experienced — I was convinced he must have graduated from the Fontaine Research Institute, but he denied it.",Friendship Lv. 4; Masquerade of the Guilty,Freminet,Fontaine
2445,Charlotte,About Neuvillette,"If you want to interview the Iudex, you have to provide all the interview questions in advance and get them reviewed by the relevant department at the Palais Mermonia, who decide which questions to approve and which ones you're not allowed to ask... It's their way of making sure the interview goes off without a hitch. It's such a rigmarole. I'm losing the will to live just talking about it.",Friendship Lv. 4,Neuvillette,Fontaine
2446,Charlotte,About Furina,"Lady Furina has a very captivating presence. She was born to be a star. Euphrasie once assigned a journalist to shadow her, but he quit not long into the assignment... From what I've heard, the reason he left was that Furina insisted on seeing every photo he took of her right away, and she'd make him redo it if she wasn't happy with how it turned out. Apparently, she was so picky that the poor guy once had to take 127 shots of her in the same pose before she was content...",Friendship Lv. 4,Furina,Fontaine
2447,Charlotte,More About Charlotte: I,"I'm well aware that following the truth wherever it leads is risky business. But buried truths make exclusive news, so good luck trying to keep secrets from me when we need a good story... telling journalist like me in this world with a strong sense of journalistic integrity! Ahem! I make it my goal to provide the public with only the best exclusive news, through powerful, engaging, and honest reporting!",,,Fontaine
2448,Charlotte,More About Charlotte: II,"When I first started working as a journalist, I didn't know anything about how to write the news, so I had to figure it all out for myself by reading articles by other people. As well as The Steambird, I also looked at some other independent publications out there, which tend to be more specialized. For example, there's ""The Observer"" for celebrity gossip, ""Leisure Weekly,"" which focuses on competitive sport and other entertainment news, ""Top Chef"" for those who like to read... all the food critiques in one place, and ""Bedazzled!"" which is just sort of a glorified rumor and speculation mill. I learned a whole lot from reading all those papers. Or... Well, I at least learned how to master a bunch of different writing styles.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Fontaine
2449,Charlotte,More About Charlotte: III,"I once spent six months working undercover for an exposé piece about a merchant who was selling shoddy food products. I disguised myself as a vagrant, infiltrated the back kitchen, took a job as a kitchen hand, and stuck around until I'd gathered enough solid evidence about their misdeeds. Then, I put it all in an article and had it published in the paper. The backlash was intense. They were punished for their crimes, sure, but that didn't stop them from launching a vicious campaign of vengeance against me almost immediately. I was coming home to threat letters sitting on my bedside table on a daily basis, and we'd also find mud slung on the front door to our office... The Steambird quickly filed a report to the Gardes, and I was sent to Mondstadt to report on Genius Invokation TCG.[Note 1] It took a while before I could safely return to Fontaine. These kind of things happen all the time. I honestly don't know Euphrasie deals with it...",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
2450,Charlotte,More About Charlotte: IV,"I've always been a very curious person. Even as a kid, long before I ever thought about going into journalism, I was always convinced that secrets and mysteries were lurking in every corner... To me, the world is a giant hoard of hidden treasure, with countless stories waiting to be uncovered. Every time I see something where I think a secret might be hiding, I snap a photo with my Kamera and add it to my collection. These photos are like my own personal treasure map... and I'm constantly going back to them, trying new ways to decipher them and expose the truth.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Fontaine
2451,Charlotte,More About Charlotte: V,"I don't really care whether these hidden truths are significant, what they mean, or what the wider ramifications are... I just want to bring them into the light of day. To put it in adventurer terms, I guess for me... it's all about the thrill of the chase, and not the treasure at the end. I've also met a lot of people along the way: all my Fontaine friends, Euphrasie, who believes I was born to be a journalist, and people like you, who join me in the search for the truth. Without everyone's help, I'd probably still be that nosy kid who runs around furiously snapping photos like a lunatic... Anywho... It's not often that I get to be the interviewee, but... this has been a real pleasure.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
2452,Charlotte,Charlotte's Hobbies,"I love collecting different Kamera lenses. They all have different strengths — some might have an incredible range of focal lengths, others might have a really wide field of view. Oh, and there's also more novelty ones that can apply special effects to the image. Take this one, for example — when you take a portrait photo with this, it turns their face all chubby... C'mon, I'll take one of you! And you, Paimon!",,,Fontaine
2453,Charlotte,Charlotte's Troubles,"I've ended up with a less-than-favorable reputation in some people's eyes — I think it's because I can sometimes be a little bit, um... intense in interviews.

2464,Xinyan,Hello,"Xinyan's the name, an' rock 'n' roll's the game — and I'm the only one who plays it in Liyue Harbor. Been thinking about staging concerts elsewhere lately, but... Hmm...

2476,Xinyan,About Xinyan: Frightening,"Not afraid of me, are you? Some folks say I've got eyes like knives, that I don't wear my clothes right, that I don't speak right. They give me a pretty wide berth, too. Really, can't a girl sport her own style without bein' looked at like she's some weird creature outta who-knows-where?",,,Liyue
2477,Xinyan,About Xinyan: Rock 'N' Roll,"Rock 'n' roll came to Liyue from Fontaine, so I guess you could call it a new thing. But it's not too hot around here. Most think it's an awful racket not fit for human ears. And that's why I appreciate everyone who does come listen, haha!",,,Liyue

2481,Xinyan,About the Vision,"I'm guessin' that I'm the only person in Teyvat who uses the fire from their Vision in rock performances. Some say I should respect that power more... But the way I see it, the gods gave the Vision to me, so they like my style, don'cha think?",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
2482,Xinyan,Something to Share: Naming,"I made this guitar myself, y'know? Based it off a rock 'n' roll instrument from Fontaine at first, but it stopped looking like the original real fast.

2483,Xinyan,Something to Share: Opera,"You ever heard of opera? It's what those rich guys listen to at their banquets. It's all tenor this and falsetto that... Gettin' so uptight about music, ugh — it's just not rock 'n' roll.",,,Liyue

2486,Xinyan,About Zhongli,"There was this one fellow who invited me to perform at his place, back when there weren't many who would give my music the time of day. I was touched, let me tell you what.

I mean, how was that appropriate?",Friendship Lv. 4,Zhongli,Liyue
2487,Xinyan,About Ningguang,"Y'know, the Millelith used to get in my way all the time. Can't set up a stage here, can't perform there. Real bother, it was... Ahem. But after I wrote to the Ministry of Civil Affairs, I heard that the Tianquan amended one of Liyue's... Uh, some rule or something. She designated some spots for performances to take place, so long as you apply. *sigh* It's still a load of trouble if you ask me, but it's better than being harangued by those Millelith every time, so...",Friendship Lv. 4,Ningguang,Liyue
2488,Xinyan,About Baizhu,"Dr. Baizhu's prescriptions are the tops at preserving my voice. I did an impromptu performance for him as thanks, but... the snake he keeps around his neck fainted away.

2489,Xinyan,About Beidou,"Her? She speaks her mind and has a big heart, and we get on great. The Crux's adventures are real epic. They've given me tons of inspiration in the past!

2490,Xinyan,About Chongyun,"He's one interesting guy. He looks introverted enough, but there was this one time when he came to one of my performances. A friend brought him or something, and he had some words for me, but I couldn't hear 'em over the music. Before I knew it, he was right up there on the stage with me, singing and rockin' his heart out. Guess you really can't judge a book by its cover!",Friendship Lv. 4,Chongyun,Liyue
2491,Xinyan,About Hu Tao,"I've no clue what she's thinking, going around looking all happy-clappy like that when she's the head of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor.

2492,Xinyan,About Yun Jin,"Tell you a secret — but you gotta keep it that way, you hear? She's real fond of rock 'n' roll. Comes to watch me at least three times a week no matter how packed her schedule is. You'd think that the head of Heyu Tea House's troupe would be into finer arts and all, eh? But I guess it gets suffocating after a while. Haha.",Friendship Lv. 4,Yun Jin,Liyue
2493,Xinyan,About Gaming,"The first time Gaming told me I had a bad case of ""rock 'n' roll fever,"" I checked my forehead to see if he was right. My temperature was fine, so I denied it. But he insisted it was true. We went back and forth arguing about it for hours before I realized it was all just a misunderstanding. Gaming explained that it was just another way to say you're a fan of something. Hahaha, there's never a dull moment when Gaming's around. Anyway, I've definitely come 'round to ""rock 'n' roll fever"" as an expression — I'll have to work it into the lyrics next time I write a song!",Friendship Lv. 4,Gaming,Liyue
2494,Xinyan,More About Xinyan: I,"You wanna know more about me? Haha! Well, aren't you just odd? Most people would do just the opposite. Well, where should we start? ...Eh, guess we'll start with rock 'n' roll.",,,Liyue
2495,Xinyan,More About Xinyan: II,"Back when I was little, the adults all said I had to be more girly, that I should learn and study all these things. Wasn't ever any good at it, though, and I'd often get roasted bad. Rock 'n' roll's a different story. No one ever taught me, but I can do it just fine. And of course, the adults say ""that's unladylike!"" *sigh* Talk about prejudice.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Liyue
2496,Xinyan,More About Xinyan: III,"Say, do you notice anything different 'bout me today?

2498,Xinyan,More About Xinyan: V,"I believe in rock 'n' roll's spirit of resistance, but I don't think it means that I have to go around shoving it in people's faces.

2499,Xinyan,Xinyan's Hobbies,"Hobbies? Rock 'n' roll, of course! You ever have that something you put your all into?

2524,Baizhu,About Baizhu: Modern vs. Ancient Medicine,"Yes, my master did entrust to me many medical formulas from the ancient era. However, although the ancient prescriptions were compiled by our ancestors and have stood the test of time, we mustn't also forget to look forward.

2525,Baizhu,About Baizhu: Bolstering Hope,"People who suffer from chronic illnesses are often mentally exhausted, and if their condition becomes critical, they may find themselves clinging to life with only a final, thin thread of hope. At such a moment, healing their body is not the priority; the doctor should focus on bolstering their faith in themselves.

2527,Baizhu,About Us: Medicine Testing,"A poison to one may be a boon to another. What may be considered to be a universally harmful substance to one group of people may prove to be the perfect medicine needed to save another room of patients. The mechanism behind this is easily understood by those well-versed in pharmacology. It's just that I can't ever tell my patients these kinds of details. If they were to find out that I gave them a poisonous substance as a prescription, it might scare them away for good.Hehe, you're the first person who's never flinched at hearing this. You are the wise Traveler after all — I'm sure you've seen a lot on your adventures. So, ahem, I suppose you'll be fine with more... potent prescriptions in the future, then?

2530,Baizhu,Something to Share: Secret Medication,"I've met some people who jump to conclusions and believe they've contracted some deadly disease the moment they experience even the slightest discomfort. Reasoning with them is useless. Eventually, I came up with some tasteless pills made of Sweet Flower and Qingxin, and prescribed them to these patients. After they calmed down and their ""symptoms"" subsided, they praised the effectiveness of my secret medication.

2532,Baizhu,About Qiqi,"Yes, you've guessed correctly. The preservation of a thread of Qiqi's consciousness was in fact the work of the adepti. It's also thanks to Qiqi that I managed to come up with a way to save someone on the brink of death.

2534,Baizhu,About Hu Tao: Exhausting Encounters,"Baizhu: If possible, I sincerely wish that Director Hu would be more sensible about her business practices.Changsheng: Oh, so you haven't forgotten about the time when she was disseminating flyers right outside of Bubu Pharmacy.Baizhu: *sigh* I just wish that she wouldn't be so concerned about Qiqi whenever she has nothing better to do.Changsheng: Sounds like you have something against her...Baizhu: It's not that I take issue with Director Hu... It's just that every time she kidnaps Qiqi, I have to go all the way to the Ministry of Civil Affairs to get someone to sort it all out. It's... quite exhausting.",Friendship Lv. 6,Hu Tao,Liyue
2535,Baizhu,About Ganyu,"Those with the blood of the adepti have strong constitutions. Even when she is ill or injured, she does not require any medicine to recover. She isn't like your average mortal, who would be left with long-term residual issues if they did not receive medical treatment after a serious injury.",Friendship Lv. 4,Ganyu,Liyue
2536,Baizhu,About Keqing,"If I were to hazard a guess about her health from a face reading, I would presume the Yuheng's frequent looks of exhaustion are due to her long-time habits of burning the midnight oil and never giving her mind a rest. If she wishes to maintain her health, she should stop working and relax from time to time. Unfortunately, she is overly ambitious, and seems to be completely willing to trade her health for her career. Even if I were to tell her this myself, I'm afraid she would not listen to me.",Friendship Lv. 4,Keqing,Liyue
2537,Baizhu,About Yaoyao,"Every time she comes to play with Qiqi, she complains about the taste of medicine and asks me if I have anything that isn't bitter. If the medicine will save someone's life, who cares how bitter it tastes, hmm?",Friendship Lv. 4,Yaoyao,Liyue
2538,Baizhu,About Zhongli,"Ah, Zhongli... Yes, I can tell he is very knowledgeable. He can carry a conversation even when discussing niche topics like ancient medicine. He must also have some habits and practices for himself when it comes to healthy living. The common headache or fever should pose no problem for him, so he doesn't need a prescription from me.",Friendship Lv. 4,Zhongli,Liyue
2539,Baizhu,About Xiao,"Baizhu: Only the most magnanimous soul could labor to preserve life by slaying evil spirits. I was once fortunate enough to see the Conqueror of Demons with my own eyes. We even brought him back to the pharmacy to take care of him for a day. Unfortunately, I did not know his true identity at the time, and didn't even have a chance to speak with him before he left on his own.Changsheng: But you've seen him since then, haven't you? There's no reason to be upset.Baizhu: Yes, you're right.",Friendship Lv. 4; The Heart of Healing,Xiao,Liyue
2540,Baizhu,About Tighnari,"Ah, so you have an acquaintance from the Sumeru Akademiya? In that case, could I trouble you to introduce me to this Tighnari? I have many questions about herbal medicine that I would like to ask him.",Friendship Lv. 4,Tighnari,Liyue
2541,Baizhu,About Gaming,"Gaming has quite a lot of scars and old injuries compared to other people his age. And every time he comes to see me, he always seems to have a new bruise here, and a new sprain there... *sigh* No matter how many times I insist that he needs to be more careful, it always goes in one ear and out the other. All I can do is teach him some useful techniques for dressing and treating his wounds. I hope he finds them useful.",Friendship Lv. 4,Gaming,Liyue
2542,Baizhu,More about [''sic''] Baizhu: I,"I am merely a mortal doctor, so I'm afraid I don't have many interesting stories to share. If you're looking for legends, then you should go to the Heyu Tea House and listen to the storytellers there.",,,Liyue
2543,Baizhu,More about Baizhu: II,"If you're looking for some kind of thrilling story, I'm afraid I don't have one. Even when I was studying medicine under my late Master, I didn't experience any particularly dire situations. My master saw that I had a good head on my shoulders, had me swear a simple oath, and took me in... That's all there was to it.",Friendship Lv. 3; The Heart of Healing,,Liyue
2544,Baizhu,More about Baizhu: III,"The oath wasn't complicated. I still remember some of it:""...When a person comes seeking medical attention, I will not consider his status, nor will I be suspicious of or worry about any subsequent consequences. I shall strive to witness the patient's distress and feel it as if were my own, for this is the hallmark of a great physician.""",Friendship Lv. 4; The Heart of Healing,,Liyue
2545,Baizhu,More about Baizhu: IV,"I understand my master's intentions. He hoped that I would be able to put myself more in the patients' shoes, and not ever be swayed by external factors. *sigh* He really did have a compassionate heart, and was always ready to sacrifice himself for others. It's unfortunate that he passed so early and never had the chance to live his years to their fullest.",Friendship Lv. 5; The Heart of Healing,,Liyue
2546,Baizhu,More about Baizhu: V,"While it is a doctor's duty to save others, the doctor is also themselves a person who deserves to be saved. If we wish to preserve lives, we should strive for an outcome where everyone will live to see another day. Those who willingly give themselves up for others are worthy of our respect, but we should not accept their sacrifice as predestined or an inevitable part of life.",Friendship Lv. 6; The Heart of Healing,,Liyue
2547,Baizhu,Baizhu's Hobbies,"I enjoy sorting medicinal ingredients and using each ingredient's unique properties to produce pills or ointments. I know this process like the back of my hand. People think that the process of making medicine is difficult and complicated, but to me, it brings endless enjoyment. Amazing, isn't it? That we can condense the bounties of heaven and earth into a tiny, unremarkable pill, and use it to bring people back from the verge of death.",,,Liyue
2548,Baizhu,Baizhu's Troubles,"The most difficult part of seeing patients isn't prescribing medication, but identifying the cause of the disease. *sigh* There could be a million reasons why someone may feel unwell. Maybe they were having a friendly Jueyun Chili-eating contest with someone, and ended up damaging their stomach without realizing it. Or maybe, circumstances led them to drink too much water, which caused them to start feeling nauseous. I just wish people would take better care of themselves, and find something better to do than repeatedly put their bodies through so much distress.",,,Liyue
2549,Baizhu,Favorite Food,"You shouldn't be a picky eater. Meat, eggs, milk, vegetables, fruit... they all have nutritional value and should be a regular part of your diet, but you should also avoid eating too much. Eating or drinking excessively can also be detrimental to your health. Take it from me. As a doctor, I know all too well that many health crises find their way into the body from the mouth.",,,Liyue
2550,Baizhu,Least Favorite Food,"Why would you ever purchase so much candy? *sigh* Just be sure not to eat it too quickly, and remember that too much candy can give you cavities. Me? I seldom indulge in sweets, and I don't often eat spicy food, either. After all, if I don't watch what I eat, then how can I expect that of my patients?",,,Liyue
2551,Baizhu,Receiving a Gift: I,"Changsheng: Superb! More please!Baizhu: It is good, isn't it?",,,Liyue
2552,Baizhu,Receiving a Gift: II,Well done. You culinary skills have improved.,,,Liyue
2553,Baizhu,Receiving a Gift: III,"Well, at least it still tastes better than medicine.",,,Liyue
2554,Baizhu,Birthday,"Changsheng: Sss. Refresh my memory, Baizhu. How do we say that again...?Baizhu: Hehe. You mean how to wish someone a happy birthday?Changsheng: Yes, precisely!Baizhu: I hope that this day will be one filled with joy every year, and that you would always keep these times near. Happy Birthday, Traveler!Changsheng: Hey, so what should I say now? Let me think... Um, uh... *sigh* I can't think of anything. I sincerely wish you a happy birthday, too.Changsheng: What are you laughing at? People are so bothersome, with more traditions and twists than even a snake.",,,Liyue
2555,Baizhu,Feelings About Ascension: Intro,Everything must take its due course. No need to be impatient.,Ascension Phase 1,,Liyue
2556,Baizhu,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up,"Thanks to your hard work, I think I'm feeling stronger than ever.",Ascension Phase 2,,Liyue
2557,Baizhu,Feelings About Ascension: Climax,"My energy is on the rise... I suppose it is due to the recent improvements in my condition. I don't feel so weary, even after a full day of seeing patients. This is all thanks to your efforts.",Ascension Phase 4,,Liyue
2558,Baizhu,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"You've been working hard day after day. Even though I'm the doctor, I've still had to trouble you with my health. *cough* How shameful... But don't worry. From this day on, I will take care of you.",Ascension Phase 6,,Liyue
2559,Arlecchino,Hello,"I am The Knave, Arlecchino, Fourth of the Fatui Harbingers. The children of the House of the Hearth call me ""Father."" I do hope our partnership proves to be a pleasant one, although I would imagine that should be fairly easy. After all, there's no cause for contention between us at the moment... wouldn't you agree?",,,Fontaine
2560,Arlecchino,Chat: Eyes,Staring into my eyes is ill-advised. I can't promise you'll like what you see...,,,Fontaine
2561,Arlecchino,Chat: Home,What could the children be up to... Hmm. Never mind. Let them do as they please.,,,Fontaine
2562,Arlecchino,Chat: Tip-Off,Something you wish to report? Go on. You have my undivided attention.,,,Fontaine
2563,Arlecchino,When Thunder Strikes,Fear not. What's a little thunder when even lightening [sic] wouldn't dare strike our path.,,,Fontaine
2564,Arlecchino,When It Snows,Only in the grip of winter do people truly appreciate the warmth of flames.,,,Fontaine
2565,Arlecchino,When the Sun Is Out,This kind of weather is more enjoyably spent under the cover of shade.,,,Fontaine
2566,Arlecchino,When the Wind Is Blowing,"I would advise you to keep your secrets close to your chest. Divulge them too easily, and you never know where the wind might carry them.",,,Fontaine
2567,Arlecchino,Good Morning,Good morning. Any plans for today?,,,Fontaine
2568,Arlecchino,Good Afternoon,"Whenever I return home at midday, I often find the children sprawled across the ground in the midst of sleep. A certain level of fatigue is common at this hour. Perhaps you, too, should rest a bit before we head out.",,,Fontaine
2569,Arlecchino,Good Evening,It is said that the moon is like an eye gazing down upon the mortal plane. We have merely grown accustomed to its scrutiny.,,,Fontaine
2570,Arlecchino,Good Night,"Time to retire for the night. Oh? ""Can't sleep,"" you say? Well, I'm afraid you'll have to figure something out for yourself. I have a certain suspicion my solution won't be to your liking.",,,Fontaine
2571,Arlecchino,About Arlecchino: Perception,"Seeing yourself clearly is a difficult task indeed, perhaps even a thankless one. After all, they say those who lack adequate powers of self-perception often lead a happier existence.",,,Fontaine
2572,Arlecchino,About Arlecchino: Cold Blood,"On occasion, I hear others whisper in secret, calling me cold and cruel. People are free to believe as they wish, and I don't intend to clear up their misconceptions. Prejudice has a way of concealing the truth, and that is hardly to my disadvantage. Still, I believe the time has come for certain measures to be taken to ""live up"" to their expectations... Let's just hope those on the receiving end of these measures have enough power and status to escape with their lives.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
2573,Arlecchino,About Us: Compromise,"Our ideals are not entirely aligned. If we are to work together, we must be willing to compromise. To that end, I'm willing to share certain secrets with you. Information that I choose not to reveal, however, is best left unexplored... for your own good, of course.",,,Fontaine
2574,Arlecchino,About Us: Being a Guest,The children simply adore your stories. They often ask me when you're coming around again. I do hope you won't let them down. Betraying their expectations comes with a price... Perhaps that's something worth your consideration.,Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
2575,Arlecchino,About the Vision,"For the longest time, there wasn't anything I desired, until the idea came to me to assassinate Crucabena. It was a ludicrous thought then. She was a Harbinger, famed and experienced, and nearly everything I knew about fighting was taught by her hand.However, it appears you need only desire something with sufficient intensity, and the gods will answer. In the end, I gained a Vision, and after making certain sacrifices, I mastered this power. Surpassing one's teacher often requires the pursuit of the unexpected.",Friendship Lv. 4; When the Hearth-Flame Goes Out,,Fontaine
2576,Arlecchino,Something to Share,"""Flames course through my body like blood""... This may be nothing but a figure of speech to some. But for me, it's the harsh reality of my existence.",,,Fontaine
2577,Arlecchino,Interesting Things: Aurora,The aurora in Snezhnaya is quite beautiful. Certainly worth a visit.,,,Fontaine
2578,Arlecchino,Interesting Things: Spiders,"I once had a pet spider named Bambi. Raising spiders is quite fascinating. They cannot be domesticated like cats or dogs. Any affection bestowed upon them will not be returned, and they require little investment in terms of care. It's the kind of relationship that suits me perfectly.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
2579,Arlecchino,About Lyney,"Clervie once asked me what a ""real home"" looks like, but I had no answer for her. How could any of us know the answer when the House of the Hearth is made up entirely of people who never had a place to call home.By killing Crucabena, I was able to assume the identity of ""Father"" and rebuild the House under a new set of rules. Still, I'm well aware that, even with these efforts, the House is far from that ideal. As for what a real home truly looks like, I suppose that question is best put to the side for now... Perhaps one day, Lyney will be able to give me a new answer.",Friendship Lv. 4; When the Hearth-Flame Goes Out,Lyney,Fontaine
2580,Arlecchino,About Lynette,"Lynette's uniquely calm personality is also her strength, and I believe she is more than clever enough to recognize that. She is an irreplaceable part of that little team of three, and I would imagine that role brings her much joy. As her ""Father,"" my duty is merely to give her the space to put those talents to good use.",Friendship Lv. 4,Lynette,Fontaine
2581,Arlecchino,About Freminet,"Freminet has a complex mind and often hides his emotions. He blames himself for things that aren't his doing and allows them to eat away at his conscience. I would imagine the other children might find it difficult to understand his manner of thinking, but you seem to share a similar delicate sensibility — perhaps you two would make good friends.",Friendship Lv. 4,Freminet,Fontaine
2582,Arlecchino,About Neuvillette,"Monsieur Neuvillette intentionally maintains a certain ""distance"" in professional and private settings. Many say this makes him cold and unfeeling, but I believe the truth is just the opposite. In order for all beings to be treated equally under the law, a certain level of emotional distance is expected. Maintaining that kind of indifference is, in itself, a demonstration of kindness.",Friendship Lv. 4,Neuvillette,Fontaine
2583,Arlecchino,About Furina,"I asked Lyney to deliver an assortment of cakes for her theater troupe to enjoy during teatime. The children made the cakes themselves as a gesture to express the support and enthusiasm of her ""audience."" I do hope she enjoys them.",Friendship Lv. 4; Masquerade of the Guilty,Furina,Fontaine
2584,Arlecchino,About the Tsaritsa,"When I was imprisoned, it was the Tsaritsa who pardoned me and gave me the title of Harbinger. I could sense she was a person of true sincerity and compassion, unlike all those pompous hypocrites with their posturing and rhetoric. Yet... It's difficult to say whether her compassion alone is enough to melt the ice and snow that permeates her land. All I can say is this... If we are forced to be at odds one day, I will raise my weapon against her without hesitation, because that is the greatest level of respect I am able to bestow.",Friendship Lv. 4,Tsaritsa,Fontaine
2585,Arlecchino,About The Jester,"As the original Harbinger, much about him remains a mystery. Upon our first meeting, he recognized my background with ease, yet to this day, I know little about him.",Friendship Lv. 4,Pierro,Fontaine
2586,Arlecchino,About The Captain,"He is very powerful, and that power comes with a high level of responsibility. However, I believe him to be someone worthy of respect independent of the power he holds.",Friendship Lv. 4,Il Capitano,Fontaine
2587,Arlecchino,About The Doctor,"When I first took over the House of the Hearth, he proposed a number of plans for us to work together. He wanted me to send any ""rejects"" to him. He planned to experiment on them and then share the results with me. I heard that he and the previous Knave had quite the professional rapport in that regard. All I can say is that, if he weren't one of my fellow Harbingers, I would have expedited their happy, little reunion long ago.",Friendship Lv. 4,Il Dottore,Fontaine
2588,Arlecchino,About Damselette,"She is a very special Harbinger. Pose her a question, and the answer you receive will be entirely unpredictable, if she sees fit to give a proper answer at all. Regardless, any answer you do receive is sure to be an interesting one.",Friendship Lv. 4,Columbina,Fontaine
2589,Arlecchino,About The Rooster,"The Rooster holds little love for me, and the feeling is mutual. He is an acceptable mayor, I suppose... perhaps even an exceptional one. He has an uncanny ability to make great gains at a small price, which has earned him substantial acclaim throughout his political circles. However ""small"" the price may be, if it continues to come at the expense of my organization, sooner or later... Hmph.",Friendship Lv. 4,Pulcinella,Fontaine
2590,Arlecchino,About Marionette,"I have little interest in her. She is extremely... passionate about her research and does not appear in public often. In fact, many of our officers have yet to see her at all. Compared to, let's say, someone who would go so far as to create segments of themselves to better wander across the land, I suppose you could say she is at the other end of the extreme.",Friendship Lv. 4,Sandrone,Fontaine
2591,Arlecchino,About Regrator,"I won't deny that he is a capable and imaginative individual, but he lacks ""clarity."" He can formulate grand plans and manipulate the economy with ease, yet at the same time, he allows his actions to be governed by the vengeance and hatred locked in the depths of his heart. Rational people often believe themselves capable of controlling their emotions, but I believe that confidence is their greatest weakness.",Friendship Lv. 4,Pantalone,Fontaine
2592,Arlecchino,About The Fair Lady,"She and Pierro were the first Harbingers I became acquainted with. Her prideful attitude when she first visited the House of the Hearth failed to earn her many friends among the children. Subsequent visits were accompanied by gifts and the stately claim that ""those who dislike me shall receive none."" The children quickly learned how to play pretend, and she in turn basked in their attention, superficial though it may have been. I imagine she quite enjoyed being surrounded by children, perhaps due to the persistent loneliness that plagued her... I found her sacrifice to be a great shame. May she be reunited with her lover in death.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
2593,Arlecchino,About Childe,"Objectively speaking, his personality is ill-suited to that of a Harbinger. He often tries to think the best of others... and finds himself used by them as a result. Of course, he is very talented. With time, I'm sure he'll come into his own. I see no need to judge him too early.",Friendship Lv. 4,Tartaglia,Fontaine
2594,Arlecchino,More About Arlecchino: I,"You wish to know more about me? Why, of course. Our relationship is one of mutual trust. There's little need to keep things hidden... I would only inquire as to whether you're truly prepared for what you might learn. Secrets can be sharper than a knife. Innocent curiosity can lead to dangerous places.",,,Fontaine
2595,Arlecchino,More About Arlecchino: II,"The moment you wield a blade, you realize that different lives carry different weights. Some people have an air of renown and distinction, yet grovel and plead for their lives when faced with death — their outward demeanor nothing more than a hollow facade. Others appear unremarkable, yet carry a heavy burden within. Despite the factors that differentiate us in life... death awaits us all — the great and final equalizer. Cruel, you say? I merely state the truth.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Fontaine
2596,Arlecchino,More About Arlecchino: III,"My Snezheviches and Snezhevnas... those with the courage to walk through shadow even when the world gets dark, and the conviction to embrace the heat even at the risk of getting burned... I will do my utmost to teach them how to navigate life. The House of the Hearth begs favors from no one — like a spider, we hunt for what we want.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
2597,Arlecchino,More About Arlecchino: IV,"No one has the power to choose where they come from, but we all have the right to fight for the life we want. In this sense, the world is both unfair and just in equal measure. I don't take in children out of a desire for recompense. In fact, should they so wish, the children are free to leave and pursue a life outside my organization... so long as they're willing to pay the price.",Friendship Lv. 5; When the Hearth-Flame Goes Out,,Fontaine
2598,Arlecchino,More About Arlecchino: V,"Fate can be a peculiar thing. When I was young, ""Mother"" favored me due to the unusual set of abilities I possess. No one was able to discern their true nature, not even me. We could only speculate that they were the result of some sort of hereditary curse. Whatever the origin of my power, all I knew was that it was the source of my strength, and often the impetus for my suffering. It was only after I became a Harbinger that I finally learned the truth from The Jester. He expressed surprise that the Crimson Moon bloodline had not gone extinct, and that, in a strange twist of fate, the House of the Hearth had ended up in the hands of an orphan of that lineage once again.I cannot say what the future holds. I trust fate will give me an answer in time, and when it does, I'm prepared to do things my way, even if that means striking down fate with my own two hands.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Fontaine
2599,Arlecchino,Arlecchino's Hobbies,"In my free time, I enjoy observing insects in the forest. The dynamics between them are fascinating — the way they hunt for food, compete with each other, even cooperate... Those that seem formidable aren't always the ones that make it until the end, and a single error can prove fatal. I observe their struggle as they near death, and slowly commit the image of their suffering to memory, much like I do for those that fall by my own hand.",,,Fontaine
2600,Arlecchino,Arlecchino's Troubles,"The children often make use of words and phrases from popular vernacular that are only comprehensible among themselves, much like the codewords we use during missions. Of course, children often need their own space, and I fully understand that.",Masquerade of the Guilty,,Fontaine
2601,Arlecchino,Favorite Food,"On occasion, we hold barbecue dinners at the House, and the children prepare the ingredients themselves. They enjoy participating in activities like that, and the feeling is mutual. After all, it's always possible certain familiar faces will be missing from the crowd the next time a similar event rolls around.",,,Fontaine
2602,Arlecchino,Least Favorite Food,I dislike complex seasonings. They dull one's sense of smell and taste. Allowing the ingredients to maintain their original flavor is also a way to respect their integrity.,,,Fontaine
2603,Arlecchino,Receiving a Gift: I,An impressive showing of culinary expertise. Perhaps you'd be interested in teaching a cooking class at the House of the Hearth?,,,Fontaine
2604,Arlecchino,Receiving a Gift: II,The taste is palatable. Perhaps the children will enjoy it.,,,Fontaine

2606,Arlecchino,Birthday,"This memo states that today is your birthday. Is that true? Birthdays should be lively occasions.

2638,Diona,About Jean,"Acting Grand Master of the Knights of Favonius... A rare, mature adult who doesn't drink... But perhaps a little too earnest, cause is it just me, or are the Knights overdoing it a bit on protecting me?",Friendship Lv. 4,Jean,Mondstadt
2639,Diona,About Albedo,Alchemy genius? Hmm... I wonder if he knows of a way to finally help me make a drink that people don't like?,Friendship Lv. 4,Albedo,Mondstadt

2641,Diona,About Xiangling,"Xiangling once gave me a ""so-awful-it-goes-with-nothing"" food combination she came up with, saying how it tasted absolutely terrible, blah blah blah... It didn't work, no use at all. All my little cat ears heard that night was ""One more cup of that good stuff!"" *sigh*",Friendship Lv. 4,Xiangling,Mondstadt
2642,Diona,About Klee,"Every time Klee wants to play with me, I take her somewhere far from the tavern. Alcohol and explosives... yeah, that's a dangerous combination! I mean, do I want to destroy the wine industry of Mondstadt? Yes, but not in that sense!",Friendship Lv. 4,Klee,Mondstadt
2643,Diona,About Her Father,"I adore my daddy more than anyone else! He's the greatest! But... Daddy after he drinks, ugh... Argh! I must bring an end to the wine industry of Mondstadt, and soon! No time for chit-chat!",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt

2645,Diona,More About Diona: II,"You wouldn't ask me to meow like a cat, like those boozehounds at the tavern do, would you? I wouldn't do it, no way!

2649,Diona,Diona's Hobbies,"I enjoy hunting. I'm especially good at tracking down prey! But Daddy says that the wild is dangerous. One should only go deep into the forest with a reliable adult. ...You're a reliable adult, right?",,,Mondstadt
2650,Diona,Diona's Troubles,"How, oh how can I make awful-tasting drinks...? I had high hopes for the soy sauce, milk, Jueyun Chili, and Dandelion Seed cocktail — my most nightmarish combination to date! But even that was met with praise at the tavern.

2673,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: Sailing,"In truth, not every night out at sea is filled with wind and waves. When the weather is clear, the moonlight flows over the rippling water, and schools of fish circle the ship's hull. At moments like that, when I look out into the distance from the prow, I feel like this journey is worth it... The only thing that takes away from that feeling is the sailors' singing. They're so loud... don't they need to sleep?",,,Inazuma
2674,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: Samurai Nobility,"The Kaedehara Clan was once a famed samurai clan. It's a pity that by the time the noble name passed to me, the title itself was all that was left. But it is enough for me.

2677,Kaedehara Kazuha,About the Vision,"As I see it, a Vision is the proof of one's strength, not the source of it. It symbolizes the mortal desire to always keep moving forward, but in this endeavor, we samurai place our faith in our blades alone.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2678,Kaedehara Kazuha,Something to Share: Bamboo Blades,"Ah, you'd like to learn the art of the sword? Let me see... Alright — here, take this. It's a bamboo blade I just made. With these, we can practice sparring without having to worry about getting injured.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2679,Kaedehara Kazuha,Something to Share: Maple Leaves,"""On this mountain path, where the red leaves lifeless lie... My heart calls for a companion, echoing the deer's cry..."" Hm...

2680,Kaedehara Kazuha,Interesting Things,"Farewell, dear gulls, please calm your cries. From this day forth, I am a wanderer once more.",,,Inazuma
2681,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Beidou,I owe Beidou my life. She took me in when I fled from Inazuma and gave me the courage to return there at the most difficult time of my life. She is a comrade in whom I and all the other sailors can place our trust.,Friendship Lv. 4,Beidou,Inazuma
2682,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Gorou,"When I was a wanted man, the resistance gave me a lot of help. The time I spent with Gorou was brief, but he left a deep impression on me. He's the type of person who says whatever's on his mind. He shares the highs and lows of his subordinates, and is never afraid to draw his sword for the sake of a friend. That's the kind of person I can really get along with.",Friendship Lv. 4,Gorou,Inazuma
2683,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kujou Sara,"She defeated my friend in a duel before the throne, which I accept as proof of her great strength. But she uses that strength to serve as an oppressor's lackey, leading the Kujou Clan's troops to relentlessly seek out and confiscate Visions. This... I cannot forgive.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kujou Sara,Inazuma
2684,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kujou Sara: Changing Perspective,I see... So she does have her own ideals that she is fighting for. But I have to wonder: can the Kujou family flourish as they did before once this storm has passed?,Friendship Lv. 4; Omnipresence Over Mortals,Kujou Sara,Inazuma
2685,Kaedehara Kazuha,About the Raiden Shogun,"I've asked myself this question many times since leaving Inazuma. Do I simply resent the Raiden Shogun because of what happened in that duel? Because of the lethal stroke she dealt my dear friend? I've thought about this a good long time, and I believe the answer is no. My friend died an honorable death in that duel, and the Shogun was not unjustified in her conduct. My dissatisfaction with her has its roots in the Vision Hunt Decree. No one has the right to rob another of their hopes and dreams — not even a god.","Friendship Lv. 4; Autumn Winds, Scarlet Leaves",Raiden Shogun,Inazuma
2686,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kamisato Ayaka,"I'm sure everyone living in Inazuma has heard of the ""Shirasagi Himegimi."" The lady of the Kamisato Clan is as perfect as a person can be, though our paths have seldom crossed. I wonder what she thinks of the state of Inazuma today?",Friendship Lv. 4,Kamisato Ayaka,Inazuma
2687,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Yoimiya,"The last time she commissioned Captain Beidou to ship fireworks to Liyue, I unloaded the shipment myself. They were so heavy! I doubt that anyone besides her could make such huge fireworks.",Friendship Lv. 4,Yoimiya,Inazuma
2688,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Sangonomiya Kokomi,"During my time with the Resistance, there was no one among our ranks who wouldn't look up to Her Excellency. As someone with a great passion for military matters, victory at all costs isn't really part of her ethos. She'd always try to limit the casualties to the minimum while planning her next move. By some accounts, it also seems that she seeks to take charge of both internal and foreign affairs for Watatsumi Island. Wouldn't that be too much to expect of herself though?",Friendship Lv. 4,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Inazuma
2689,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Shikanoin Heizou,"Don't be deceived by his happy-go-lucky disposition. As soon as he gets working on a case, that restless energy he carries around turns into a razor-sharp focus. It's quite remarkable to witness.",Friendship Lv. 4,Shikanoin Heizou,Inazuma
2690,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: I,"You'd like to know more about me, you say? Well, as you see, I am but a wandering samurai that you could have run into just about anywhere.",,,Inazuma
2691,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: II,"I have a very keen sense of hearing. My ears pick up all sorts of sounds: the wind through the mountain passes, the parting clouds, the sound of foxes chewing on apples in the forest, the sound of crabs blowing bubbles... This is nature's favor, it allows me to sense danger long before it draws near.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Inazuma
2692,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: III,"I used to love the rain when I was small. The sound of it would lull me into a peaceful sleep. But since I've grown older, my feelings have become more... complicated. I still like to listen to the rain today, but whenever I see the storm clouds start to gather, my heart sinks and I can't help but wonder: ""Hm... will some nice person let me stay the night today?"" Listening to the rain in drenched clothes is hardly peaceful — hehe... nothing can be when you're constantly interrupting yourself by sneezing.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2693,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: IV,"I never stay in a single place for very long. Stagnancy dulls both my connection with nature and the blade I wield. While I am still able to, I want to travel far and wide and meet all sorts of different people.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Inazuma
2694,Kaedehara Kazuha,About Kaedehara Kazuha: V,"Don't worry — even if the day comes for us to go our separate ways, I am certain that we will meet again, in some corner of the world. The fate that brings people together is not a cord so easily cut.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
2695,Kaedehara Kazuha,Kaedehara Kazuha's Hobbies,"I like falling asleep on a warm rock that's been soaking in the mid-afternoon sun, then waking up and continuing on my journey with no particular aim in mind. So long as I have my blade by my side, there is nowhere I cannot go.",,,Inazuma
2696,Kaedehara Kazuha,Kaedehara Kazuha's Troubles,"The sounds of nature turn into a clamor of noise during stormy weather. It becomes a constant buzz in my ears. If it happens at night, I end up tossing and turning all night long without getting a wink of sleep. It's quite the headache...",,,Inazuma
2697,Kaedehara Kazuha,Favorite Food,"The most easily obtainable food source when you're out at sea is, of course, fish. So it goes without saying that a seafaring adventurer must give careful consideration to how to cook a tasty fish-based meal... If the chance arises, I'd like you to try some of my cooking.",,,Inazuma
2698,Kaedehara Kazuha,Least Favorite Food,"I am not particularly fond of food that is thrown together in a hurry without much care and attention. The way I see it, if your meal consists of a single fish, you should grill it to perfection. Eating is supposed to be an enjoyable experience, so how can we stand to be so slapdash about it?",,,Inazuma
2699,Kaedehara Kazuha,Receiving a Gift: I,That you can make fish taste as delicious as this is proof of your outstanding culinary prowess.,,,Inazuma

2701,Kaedehara Kazuha,Receiving a Gift: III,Perhaps you should get some rest? A weary mind is a recipe for flavorless food.,,,Inazuma
2702,Kaedehara Kazuha,Birthday,"I heard it was your birthday, so I wrote a haiku for you. Unfortunately, I'm not the most talented in this area, and after trying for several evenings, I was still only able to come up with the first two lines... I guess I'll just share what I've got so far, then. ""Sun and moon rejoice / Birds of dawn sing songs anew""... Wait, don't say a word, I think the final line is coming to me... Yes, how about....

2719,Noelle,About Noelle: Discipline,"In my job, I do the exact same things every day — a far cry from being a true knight, that's for sure. But ultimately, this is all part of my training, and when it comes to training, actions speak louder than words.",,,Mondstadt
2720,Noelle,About Noelle: Disagreement,"I'm a bit useless in an argument because I can't really explain my reasoning clearly. People find that hard to understand, so instead, I try to just get on with my work in my own way. But then they call me stubborn. All I try to do is convince people with results instead of trying to talk them round... Is that really stubborn of me?",,,Mondstadt
2721,Noelle,About Us: Identities,"I am devoted to what I do, but make no mistake — I devote myself freely. A maid, to me, is the most liberating job there is. I'm a chef, a gardener, a warrior, a guide... I can be anything you need me to be!",,,Mondstadt
2722,Noelle,About Us: Reminders,"Even when you're too busy to eat three square meals, never eat something if you don't know where it came from, and always maintain a balance between meat and vegetables.

2724,Noelle,About the Vision,"To be honest, I'm feeling a little dejected. Sure, this Vision proves that the Archons think I'm worthy, but why is it a Geo Vision? I mean, Geo's the furthest thing from Anemo, and for a Knight of Favonius...",Friendship Lv. 4,,Mondstadt
2725,Noelle,Something to Share,"I actually really like the smell of wine, I'm just not of drinking age yet. There have been a few times when I could have had a little taste if I'd wanted, and no one would ever have known... but I resisted the temptation. I feel like the first time you try it is probably really magical, so I want to save it till I'm older.",,,Mondstadt
2726,Noelle,Interesting Things,"A maid is required to keep everyone's secrets. That's why my favorite flower is the rose. Here in Mondstadt, the rose represents the saying ""As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed."" It reminds me to— What? ...Roses represent love in your hometown? I—I had no idea the rose held such a... passionate meaning.",,,Mondstadt
2727,Noelle,About Amber,"I really look up to Amber. Not only is she an accomplished knight, but she's a kind person too. She taught me how to make a Baron Bunny. I keep it on my person for luck, and it looks quite alright I think. Oh no, please do not be alarmed. There's no risk of explosion whatsoever.",Friendship Lv. 4,Amber,Mondstadt
2728,Noelle,About Klee,"I've always been curious as to how she managed to become a fully-fledged knight at such a young age. I actually went to ask her for tips once, but I'd barely started talking to her when she grabbed me by the hand and took me outside the Knights headquarters to play with bombs. I thought it was some kind of training exercise at first, but Jean found us, and we both ended up in a solitary confinement...",Friendship Lv. 4,Klee,Mondstadt
2729,Noelle,About Jean,"Master Jean has always been my role model, both in terms of ability and dedication. She holds herself and others to the same high standards, so if there ever comes a day when I meet with her approval, it will be the ultimate acknowledgment of all my efforts so far. Until then, there's no room for complacency!",Friendship Lv. 4,Jean,Mondstadt
2730,Noelle,About Varka,"At first I wanted to join his expedition party and do my part as a maid. But the Grand Master said no — it would give him more peace of mind if I stayed behind to take care of things in Mondstadt. It made me so happy to hear how much he values me! ...Okay, so apparently he said the same thing to a lot of people. But that doesn't change the fact he prizes me too!",Friendship Lv. 4,Varka,Mondstadt
2731,Noelle,About Kaeya,"He's a mysterious character! He comes and goes like the wind, and is always occupied with important business. I like the fact that he delegates some of the smaller jobs to me sometimes, it's nice to feel like part of the team, you know... What do you mean, ""errand runner""? I don't see it like that at all! Okay, well yes, technically I run errands for him. But still, I really appreciate it!",Friendship Lv. 4,Kaeya,Mondstadt
2732,Noelle,About Bennett,"He's asked me to join the Adventurers' Guild more than a few times, saying that life there would suit me better than with the Knights of Favonius.

No, I simply cannot accept his offer.",Friendship Lv. 4,Bennett,Mondstadt
2733,Noelle,About Fischl: Tea,"I think she's from another world, but I don't know the details. One thing I do know, however, is that she loves the Knights of Favonius' library. She can always be found there with her nose in a book. I bring her some refreshments whenever I go in there to clean, and she always thanks me profusely. When I say profusely... I mean she goes a bit over the top, to be honest, and... I actually don't understand half of what she's saying.",Friendship Lv. 4,Fischl,Mondstadt
2734,Noelle,About Fischl: Background,"So once when I was cleaning the library, I noticed a book on the shelf called Flowers for Princess Fischl. At the time I assumed it was just a fantasy novel... I was so surprised to find out the main character is a real person. I could hardly believe it! She must be someone incredible to have a whole book dedicated to her.",Friendship Lv. 6,Fischl,Mondstadt
2735,Noelle,About Barbara,"We take tea breaks together sometimes. Often she'll start humming a tune, saying inspiration has come to her. I'm not the right person to give useful feedback on anything musical... But I still love spending time with Barbara.",Friendship Lv. 4,Barbara,Mondstadt

2737,Noelle,More About Noelle: II,"Not a problem, I am here to serve in whatever capacity you require. You needn't be concerned about the way I feel. ...Huh? More tool than maid? I disagree! A tool might help you to complete a million tasks to a satisfactory standard, but it feels nothing.

2738,Noelle,More About Noelle: III,"Th—These treats are for me? Oh no, I couldn't, really. Well... Then I'll make some for you too! I'll go right now, right this instant! Half an hour...

2739,Noelle,More About Noelle: IV,"I spend all my days handling the most trivial of matters, but so long as it helps you in your adventure, or makes your life easier in some small way, I couldn't be happier.

2740,Noelle,More About Noelle: V,"Even though I mostly work for the Knights of Favonius, I'm always looking out for ways I can help more people.

2742,Noelle,Noelle's Troubles,"How to get more for your Mora? Last time I went all the way to Liyue, I visited every single shop to compare prices, and then carried everything back myself...

2743,Noelle,Favorite Food,"My favorite is easily a Satisfying Salad. The best of Mondstadt's natural produce on one plate — highly nutritious, and a low calorie count. No, I never get sick of eating it — it's delicious! I've been eating it for ten years now.",,,Mondstadt
2744,Noelle,Least Favorite Food,"I'm not a fussy eater, but I really don't like banquets... The reason being, as the maid, I am expected to sample every single dish on the table to ensure its quality. Just one bite of each, of course, but it all adds up... Oh, the guilt...",,,Mondstadt
2745,Noelle,Receiving a Gift: I,How can you make such a simple dish taste so good? My admiration towards you just keeps growing!,,,Mondstadt

2748,Noelle,Birthday,"Since you're always so busy adventuring, there must be so many little things you never get round to, surely?

2751,Noelle,Feelings About Ascension: Climax,"Thank you for the opportunity to accompany you on your adventures, it's taught me a lot and I believe I have improved a lot.

2752,Noelle,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"Everyone in Mondstadt is saying that I'm much more reliable now. Some even say that I'm to be made a true knight soon, but I don't think... What!? You think so too!? Oooohh, thank you! Coming from you, that is the best compliment I could ever hope for!",Ascension Phase 6,,Mondstadt
2753,Navia,Hello,"Nice to meet you! I am Navia, the esteemed president, leader, commander-in-chief, executive director, and Boss of Spina di Rosula.

2754,Navia,Chat: Traveling,"I really wanna go traveling! I don't mind where we go, as long as I have my friends with me, hehe.",,,Fontaine
2755,Navia,Chat: Speaking From Experience,My time with the Spina has taught me that carrying an unreliable weapon is worse than not carrying one at all.,,,Fontaine
2756,Navia,Chat: Logo,I do love Spina di Rosula's logo. It was designed by my mother. Have you noticed how it's shaped like a heart?,,,Fontaine

2760,Navia,When the Sun Is Out,"Quick, look! Up in the sky! Look at that scorching sun, it's like a blast furnace! You know what this means?

2770,Navia,About Us: Partners,"Some people call me ""Boss,"" others ""Demoiselle,"" but none of that does anything for me. My favorite thing to be called is ""partner"" — but only by you, of course. So, just know that my vainer side would be over the moon if you could indulge me a little more often.",As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,,Fontaine
2771,Navia,About Us: Keeping Secrets,"People say that a secret shared is a secret no more, but I like to think that true friends keep each other's secrets. ...What? Veiled threat? No, of course not!

2772,Navia,About the Vision,"Here, take a look at my Vision! I love how shiny it is. Doesn't it go great with my dress?Still, it's nothing compared to using the elements without a Vision... And with no training or anything either, right? So cool.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
2773,Navia,Something to Share: Dogs,"My favorite dog breed of all is the chestnut hunting hound. You know how they have the little spots above their eyes? They look just like eyebrows, don't they? That's why they look so innocent and earnest all the time. Please keep this a secret for me, though — I don't wanna hurt the other dogs' feelings!",,,Fontaine
2774,Navia,Something to Share: The Dependable Spina di Rosula,"If you've spent long enough in the Fleuve Cendre, you might have noticed that there are a lot of other groups in Fontaine besides the Spina di Rosula. Beware of them — they each have their own agenda, and they're not all friendly like us. If you ever find yourself in a tight spot, you can always ask Mr. Tetreaux at the bar for help. Unless you're dealing with someone who isn't in the mood to sit down and have a conversation, in which case... White Glove will sort things out. You can count on him.",,,Fontaine
2775,Navia,Interesting Things,"I really love the Pluie Lotus — it's such a beautiful color. Plus, when you see them in full bloom, it's a sure sign that the rainy season is finally over.",,,Fontaine
2776,Navia,About Clorinde,"She might not say much, or show a lot of emotion, but I can tell that she feels deeply. After my father's death, I... well, it caused quite a rift between us for a long time. But even then, I never did like having her constantly walking on eggshells around me... I much prefer how things are now.",Friendship Lv. 4; Masquerade of the Guilty,Clorinde,Fontaine
2777,Navia,About Charlotte,"Charlotte's known for her fast-and-furious reporting, but it's her photography skills that really impress me. She once snapped a quick photo of me, a waist-up shot, and the result was absolutely stunning — it was like looking at an oil painting. She seems to have a knack for writing extraordinary news stories and taking the most eye-catching photos. Guess she was born to be a journalist.",Friendship Lv. 4,Charlotte,Fontaine
2778,Navia,About Chiori,"Ah, the fashion designer who brought the coolest Inazuman trends to Fontaine? She's actually been a great help to the Spina behind the scenes. She says my unorthodox ideas always give her a lot of inspiration for her work, and from what I can tell, I think she means it. Still, she drew the line at my request for a ten-meter-tall top hat. *sigh* Missed opportunity, if you ask me... Imagine seeing one of those in front of the shop! It would be a great way to draw in customers.",Friendship Lv. 4,Chiori,Fontaine
2779,Navia,About Furina,"I was lucky enough to catch her in an opera when I was young. Even though it was a charity show, the tickets were nearly impossible to get! She was performing in character then, but I thought she seemed more in her element then than she ever did as an Archon, giving speeches up in the opera box... Looking back, I guess my intuition was right.",Friendship Lv. 4; Masquerade of the Guilty,Furina,Fontaine
2780,Navia,About Neuvillette,"Ah, how to describe Monsieur Neuvillette... He's... complex, in some ways — but very straightforward in others. I guess a good analogy would be rocky reefs in the sea: Trying to navigate through obstacles you can't see makes for a bumpy ride, but if you can figure out how they work, you start to spot the signs.",Friendship Lv. 4; As Light Rain Falls Without Reason,Neuvillette,Fontaine
2781,Navia,About Wriothesley,"Trying to discuss anything with that guy is an exhausting process. Clorinde says I needn't have any reservations about collaborating with him in the scope of our preexisting agreement, but I still shouldn't trust everything that comes out of his mouth. No wonder my father never tried to get involved with the affairs of the Fortress... I think I'll play it safe and keep things that way.",Friendship Lv. 4,Wriothesley,Fontaine
2782,Navia,About The Knave,"She is a formidable but caring leader, and definitely comes across like a master of the house. But she's still a Fatui Harbinger, and that means she must have a more ruthless side. So don't worry — while I'll always appreciate what she did for Poisson, I'm not about to let my guard down around her completely.",Friendship Lv. 4; Masquerade of the Guilty,Arlecchino,Fontaine
2783,Navia,About Lyney and Lynette,"I know magicians can often be all bravado and razzmatazz, but I can tell that Lyney is a sincere guy who cares deeply about his friends and family. He's so mature for his age, it catches me off guard sometimes... Oh, and how could I forget — it was so kind of him to try and cheer up the children in Poisson with an impromptu free magic show during the flood! I'll have to invite him and Lynette over for some macarons at my place when I get the chance. I know Lynette's always conjuring teacups out of thin air, so surely at least she's a fan of a proper tea break?",Friendship Lv. 4; Masquerade of the Guilty,Lynette; Lyney,Fontaine
2784,Navia,More About Navia: I,"The Spina's work is basically... well, a little bit of everything, but the focus is always on solving other people's problems. ...That probably makes it sound worse than it is, though. Sure, I'm making other people's problems my own, but I always get a real boost out of being able to help people.",,,Fontaine
2785,Navia,More About Navia: II,"I've always thought that it's important to appreciate the beauty in the world. The blossoms in the spring, summers by the sea, the smiles on your friends' faces... You shouldn't take those things for granted.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Fontaine
2786,Navia,More About Navia: III,"Sometimes, I like to go out into the wild, find a quiet place with no one else around, and do some target practice.It's a great way to destress! Wanna try?

I still remember everything that my father and Nanny Bracari ever taught me!",Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine
2787,Navia,More About Navia: IV,"I won't become the same kind of person as my father was. Some veterans of the Spina think that I'm becoming more and more like him, but I think the trend they're referring to is a superficial one, born out of the simple fact that some problems only have so many solutions. Spina di Rosula has changed a lot since my father's day, and I intend to be the president for the Spina of today.",Friendship Lv. 5; Braving the Tides Together,,Fontaine
2788,Navia,More About Navia: V,"I also don't think I'm going to turn into my mother, either. People say we have similar personalities, and I can kind of understand her reasons for making the decisions she did back in the day, but even so...Huh, I have a sudden urge to take a trip on the Clementine Line. Could you come with me? I don't have a particular goal in mind, but... maybe we could take a walk around the city afterwards?",Friendship Lv. 6; Braving the Tides Together,,Fontaine
2789,Navia,Navia's Hobbies,"I've loved baking ever since I was a child. Don't you think it's magical? You throw a bunch of random ingredients together in the right amounts, put the mixture in the oven, and then just watch as it slowly balloons up and transforms into a delicious treat...Hey, do you wanna make gingerbread together sometime? We can make it into a fun little competition — see who can build the biggest, most beautiful gingerbread house!",,,Fontaine
2790,Navia,Navia's Troubles,"Ugh, cleaning up after baking a cake is a nightmare. The flour just gets everywhere, and the leftover egg whites and cream go all sticky and gross... I'll, um... I'll just go find a helper!",,,Fontaine
2791,Navia,Favorite Food,"I like trying new things, for the surprise factor. But before you question my sense of taste, let me clarify that just because I can appreciate the novelty in a dish doesn't mean I'm claiming it tastes amazing.",,,Fontaine
2792,Navia,Least Favorite Food,"I never enjoy leftovers that have been left too long. It just feels like sacrilege to neglect the poor food when it's fresh, then eat after it's gone stale...",,,Fontaine
2793,Navia,Receiving a Gift: I,"This is some incredible cooking! Next time we head out together, looks like I should carry the ingredients and cookware, and let you be the chef.",,,Fontaine

2800,Navia,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"All I need now is a nice pot of soothing tea with a little milk, and our tea party can finally commence...

2801,Yoimiya,Hello,"Welcome to Naganohara! My name is Yoimiya — just let me know if you need anything! We have Kushikatsu, Egg Roll... Wait, no, we're not a restaurant. We make fireworks! Like these, see? Sparkling, crackling, little fireworks~",,,Inazuma

2813,Yoimiya,About Yoimiya: Family Matters,"My father's hearing isn't very good. When I was young, he would always smile no matter what I said to him, and so I thought that everything I said was correct. So I kept talking, and he would keep smiling. Later, I found out that he was smiling because he couldn't hear clearly, but... as long as he's truly happy, I'll keep talking to him.",,,Inazuma
2814,Yoimiya,About Yoimiya: Talking,"I don't worry about ""loose lips sinking ships."" The emotions contained in the words people say don't lie.

2816,Yoimiya,About Us: Companionship,"It actually doesn't matter what I do. What matters are the people I work with. When I'm with you, even simple things like watching the scenery or kicking a small jar about make me happy. Talking to you never gets old, after all.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
2817,Yoimiya,About the Vision,"Let me let you in on a little secret. When I first received my Vision, I used it as a flint to light fireworks and boil water, before returning home, chucking it into a storeroom, and forgetting all about it. In the end, it was my father who found it and told me that it was a precious item that I should keep safe. Haha, at least it didn't get taken back by our dear Archon.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2818,Yoimiya,Something to Share: Lantern Rite,"Did you know? A lot of the fireworks used during Liyue's Lantern Rite were purchased from our shop. I made them to order before asking Beidou to ship them to Liyue. Exports like these aren't allowed under the Sakoku Decree, but... How can there be festivals without fireworks?",,,Inazuma
2819,Yoimiya,Something to Share: Cycles,"""When the last sparks of the fireworks have disappeared into the sky, they turn into rain and snow, and will fall upon the earth again, nourishing the land and nurturing humanity, so that someday they can be sent up into the sky again and display their magnificence."" Of the many stories my father told me, this one is my favorite.",,,Inazuma
2820,Yoimiya,Something to Share: Spots of Light,"Did you ever try to step on a spot of light before as a child? You know, those patches on the ground created when the sunlight passes through the leaves. I once thought that it would disappear if I stepped on it, but it would always jump onto my foot instead. I tried and tried and tried, but I never succeeded... Quite the sore loser I was, then — sitting on a rock, sighing to myself and thinking, ""Ah, so there are things in this world that can't be stepped on...""",,,Inazuma
2821,Yoimiya,Interesting Things,"While squatting next to some children and watching them catch goldfish during one summer festival, I suddenly had a thought: could I make fireworks that could go off on the surface of the water? Thus, the ""Goldfish Fireworks"" were born! They can swim here and there, emit multi-colored lights, and they can even spit bubbles! I never thought that it would actually work, but I guess wonders never cease.",,,Inazuma
2822,Yoimiya,About Beidou,"Beidou's been helping me ship my fireworks out ever since Inazuma was locked down. I prepared a huge boat-shaped firework just to surprise her — and when the Crux Fleet was about to leave, this firework went whoosh! Right in front of their eyes, straight into the sky. The sailors got such a huge fright — they thought one of their ships had somehow flown off! But Beidou liked that trick very much, saying that it was exactly what a pleasant surprise should be — very pleasant, and a surprise.",Friendship Lv. 4,Beidou,Inazuma
2823,Yoimiya,About the Raiden Shogun,"Fireworks are probably the furthest thing from the ""eternity"" that the Shogun pursues. She probably feels that their transient glory has no practical purpose in Inazuma. *sigh* It's probably something that one who has ""eternity"" in their grasp will find hard to comprehend. It is precisely because we mortals are like fleeting shadows that we need to treasure such flickers of beauty.",Friendship Lv. 4,Raiden Shogun,Inazuma
2824,Yoimiya,About Kamisato Ayaka: Seriousness,"We cooperate a lot due to work. Unlike people in the other two Commissions, she always lets me finish speaking and answers me seriously without showing any impatience. I'd say that the word ""ladylike"" was practically made just for her.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kamisato Ayaka,Inazuma
2825,Yoimiya,About Kamisato Ayaka: Baths,"We once discussed matters concerning the summer festival deep into the night. We were both really tired, and I invited her to go take a bath. But when she heard that it involved many people bathing in the same pool, she went red in an instant! That was when I first learned that noble ladies can't use public baths.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kamisato Ayaka,Inazuma
2826,Yoimiya,About Thoma,"He's quite the talker and has reasons behind every word that he says. Sometimes, it might seem like there's no connection, but as he goes on, everything will eventually dovetail nicely towards a single purpose. It's... quite different from how I do things. I ask him for help whenever I encounter a matter I can't settle.",Friendship Lv. 4,Thoma,Inazuma
2827,Yoimiya,About Yae Miko,"Ayaka once asked me during a ritual at the shrine if I could prepare some fireworks for the Lady Guuji's leisure. I thought to myself, ""isn't the Lady Guuji supposed to sit inside the shrine throughout the ritual?"" So I watched her the whole time during the ritual, wondering how she'd like to release fireworks. I waited, and I waited, and then Ayaka came over at length to tell me that the Lady Guuji was most pleased. I mean, what? She'd already released the fireworks? Was the person sitting inside the shrine not her, then?",Friendship Lv. 4,Yae Miko,Inazuma
2828,Yoimiya,About Arataki Itto: Duels,"Oh, he may look scary, but he is very popular with the children. However, he can be very competitive. Every time we play with the children, it always turns into a showdown between him and me. For example, we'd drink a bowl of ramen soup in one go, or try to eat sour plums without making any faces. The children will cheer us both on and try to guess the winner. And when that happens... well, then I can't let him beat me, right?",Friendship Lv. 4,Arataki Itto,Inazuma
2829,Yoimiya,About Arataki's Gang,Arataki's gang? Huh!? So he isn't just someone with too much free time on his hands?,Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2830,Yoimiya,About Kaedehara Kazuha,"People with no worries like myself speak plainly, while those with many cares often speak of ancient poetry or the scenery. They talk of flowers and birds, wind and moon, but never about the reality that confronts them. He's got quite the tale to tell, I'm sure.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kaedehara Kazuha,Inazuma
2831,Yoimiya,About Kujou Sara,"Due to public safety and fire hazard-related concerns, I often get whisked off to the Tenryou Commission's place for a lecture. Kujou Sara's probably the most reasonable of the bunch. At least she'll hear me out before passing any judgment. If I'm in the right, she'll acknowledge my perspective, and if I'm wrong... Hehe, then I'll get Thoma to come and help me apologize to her!",Friendship Lv. 4,Kujou Sara,Inazuma
2832,Yoimiya,About Sayu,"Let me know if you see her, alright? I'd really love to take her to one of the festivals and introduce her to lots of new friends. She always looks a little down, but if she meets some people she can hang out with, maybe she'll slowly pick herself up again!",Friendship Lv. 4,Sayu,Inazuma
2833,Yoimiya,About Klee,"Wait, you said there was a kid in Mondstadt who was good at making bombs?... Now, they aren't much different from fireworks. In other words, she might be a genius... Ohh, I'd love to meet her. *sigh* But isn't it dangerous to let children play with explosives? Don't the people of Mondstadt worry about that?",Friendship Lv. 4,Klee,Inazuma
2834,Yoimiya,About Kirara,"The courier from Komaniya Express? She's super reliable and really quick on her feet! Ingredients used in coloring the fireworks always run out quickly, but she always delivers a new batch right when I need them! I gave her a firework once as a thank-you gift, but she was too scared to light it, saying that she got spooked once by the sound of fireworks. Hehe, so I told her to find a nice viewing spot far away and set it off for her.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kirara,Inazuma
2835,Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: I,"You wanna hear a story? Alright, alright. Sit here, and I shall tell you the story I'm most proud of — the story of the Naganohara family! You'll rarely ever hear me talk about something this serious, you know?",,,Inazuma
2836,Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: II,"Our family has a long tradition in which we will give every client who orders customized fireworks a note. Its contents can only be understood by our family, and it records the specific formula of the fireworks that were ordered. Whether ten years or a hundred years pass, our family can make exactly the same fireworks as they did in the past so long as the client brings us that note.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Inazuma
2837,Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: III,The loveliest fireworks go along with the most wondrous moments. Tiny little emotions that can easily slip away are captured within these fireworks and passed down in a different form. The notes we give our clients are like a key that awaits those who wish to open a gate to commemorate the past. We at Naganohara are the keepers of that gate.,Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
2838,Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: IV,"Every moment of the summer festival is a moving tale. Those who meet under the light of fireworks grow up, mature, and grow old. When they set off the same fireworks as they did in the beginning, the skies reflect that same image from years ago... Fireworks are not eternal, but I believe that the wonderful emotions behind them should walk alongside Inazuma into eternity.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Inazuma
2839,Yoimiya,More About Yoimiya: V,"I shan't tell the final tale, I think. Instead, let's watch the fireworks together in silence. You can record the beautiful scenery and all the things you wanna say down. Not that this is the end, of course.

2840,Yoimiya,Yoimiya's Hobbies: Playing,"Fireworks! Wait, that doesn't count? Well then, let me think. Um... This one's a toughie.

There are countless reasons why people do things in this world, and upon hearing some of those reasons, you can't help but start to feel that the wrongdoer had a point, or that the public is being too harsh on them.

2891,Cyno,Cyno's Troubles,"Just recently, I saw a light novel from Inazuma based on Genius Invokation TCG. When the main character found themselves in a rough spot, they somehow drew a card that wasn't even supposed to exist. This shook me to the core, and presented me with a great conundrum: Through directly manipulating the deck, they were able to pull off a miracle that nobody could have expected.

2964,Gaming,About the Vision,"Some martial arts novels say that the key to becoming a kung-fu master is tapping into the body's yin-yang energy reserves, hidden in the governor and conception vessels. Well, that's what getting a Vision felt like! ...Haha, just kidding. I'm no kung-fu master — just a good neighbor, thanks to the extra energy it gives me.

2965,Gaming,Something to Share,"Man Chai's such a little rascal! I gave him the name 'cause it means ""well-behaved,"" hoping it would rub off on him. Heh... whole lot of good that did! But it's no biggie, all that hyperactive energy makes for a more exciting wushou dance. Also, I feel like watching Man Chai has helped me get a better handle on how suanni look in action.

Once, she saw that my Wushou head was looking a little worse for wear, and instantly said she could make, like, ten more for me, all twice my size.

2979,Gaming,More About Gaming: II,"You can tell if someone's a pushover just by looking at their basic kung fu skills: horse stance, kicks, splits, jumps, tumbling... If you can't even hack those, hoo boy. Best-case scenario, you might fall off a high pole during a wushou dance and be bedridden for a couple of weeks. Worst-case scenario, you run into bandits on a delivery run and you can't fight 'em off. Definitely lose the cargo, probably your life too... Scary thought, huh? Yeah, I thought so too — that's why I said it to the other guys in the agency to persuade them to train with me! Hahaha.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Liyue
2980,Gaming,More About Gaming: III,"They're delicate y'know — the wushou head and blanket, the drums, the cymbals — and I practice a lot, so they deteriorate pretty quickly. You gotta be diligent about maintaining that stuff, and it costs a lot of Mora. Then there's the meals out with friends, gift-shopping for birthdays and festivals, spotting my buddies a few Mora when they're strapped for cash... It all adds up.

2981,Gaming,More About Gaming: IV,"My dad keeps hoping I'll come 'round to the idea of him teaching me how to do business one day. He doesn't seem to realize that the whole reason I left my hometown in the first place is 'cause I've already figured out what's best for me. Firstly, I wanna show him that my wushou dancing isn't just a phase — I'm gonna make a name for myself or die trying! Secondly... I'm done clashing with him all the time.

That was last month, and it's almost healed now. This scar right here, though, that was a doozie and a half. I had a bad fall the first time I was practicing on the high pole — cut myself up pretty bad. There was so much blood, I thought my wushou dancing career was over before it began...

3060,Ganyu,About the Vision,"""With authority over a thousand comes responsibility to a thousand."" Rex Lapis knows the meaning of hardship better than anyone else in Liyue — he has seen everything that has happened from ancient times to the present day, and yet he was forced to give up his entire life.

3063,Ganyu,Interesting Facts: Qingxin,"Qingxin Flower petals are pretty tasty. Incredibly tasty, actually.

3066,Ganyu,About Ningguang,"Each Tianquan adds their own interpretation and amendments to the founding laws of Liyue.

3075,Ganyu,About Shenhe,"I actually don't know her all that well — I've only heard bits and pieces from Cloud Retainer. From what I've heard, she can be quite ferocious.

3076,Ganyu,About Yelan,"Even though Ms. Yelan is absent from work for the majority of the year, I'm sure Lady Ningguang must have her reasons for making exceptions for her.

3077,Ganyu,About Xianyun,"Cloud Retainer... Oh, I mean, Ms. Xianyun — we went shopping together a while back, but we ended up stopping at every single stall, and she wanted to inspect every item they sold before we could leave.

3083,Ganyu,Ganyu's Hobbies,"My hobby... I would say my job. What? Why don't jobs count as hobbies? I thought hobbies are supposed to be things you look forward to doing, and that make you feel good when you've done them? That describes my job perfectly. So what's the issue?",,,Liyue
3084,Ganyu,Ganyu's Troubles,"I don't understand why people insist on going all out to try and prove how their existence is more valuable than everyone else's. To exist in the first place is a beautiful thing, and that's enough... isn't it?",,,Liyue

3107,Shikanoin Heizou,About Shikanoin Heizou: Detective,"A detective should be using their smarts to crush criminals' hopes of getting away with their crimes. So really, a true detective should never even have to touch their weapon.",,,Inazuma
3108,Shikanoin Heizou,About Shikanoin Heizou: Keywords,"I've made it a habit of mine to remember everything I observe in the form of keywords. They're a big help to me when I'm trying to make deductions. Take this person for example: we've got ""cat hair on clean trousers,"" and ""scratch on the wrist."" Looks like they have a soft spot for animals, but they can't get cats to reciprocate... Meanwhile, that one seems very troubled about their ""injured hand,"" and they're wearing a pair of ""brand-new shoes that don't match their well-worn attire""... Hold on, it looks like I might have a new case on my hands here!",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
3109,Shikanoin Heizou,About Us: Commissions,"Seems to me like these commissions of yours are an endless gold mine of cases, and you'll never be able to finish them all. So maybe you could throw one my way every once in a while? Not the ones that involve fighting, running errands, or searching for lost items — as you know, not my style. I only take on big, important cases with lots of mysteries to solve... So, keep an eye out for me, yeah? Hehe.",,,Inazuma
3110,Shikanoin Heizou,About Us: Destined Outcome,"""Coincidence"" is a nice word. It makes things sound like they were meant to be. Unfortunately, as a detective, I don't believe in coincidences. The two of us meeting each other is really the culmination of every choice and move we've made up to this point. So what I'm saying is... our destiny is something we choose.",,,Inazuma
3111,Shikanoin Heizou,About the Vision,"Oh? So there are rumors that I can overpower my Tenryou colleagues without even using my Vision? Hehe, well, let me set the record straight. One: Although I am technically a Doushin, I'm strictly a detective. My mind is my greatest tool, not my muscles.

3112,Shikanoin Heizou,Something to Share: Sense of Achievement,"As you piece together the trail of clues, it brings you closer and closer to the culprit... and then, that moment when you finally put the last piece of the puzzle into place... I always get such a sense of accomplishment. It's exhilarating!",,,Inazuma
3113,Shikanoin Heizou,Something to Share: Doushin,"Not only does being a Doushin come with a certain amount of prestige, it also puts me closer to the action on some of the toughest cases, so the position has definitely broadened my horizons compared to when I was at the detective agency. As for the other duties — patrolling, apprehending criminals, and so on — obviously, I leave that to the more... qualified individuals. There's a limit to how much a single detective can do, you know.",,,Inazuma
3114,Shikanoin Heizou,Interesting Things,"Question, Traveler, how much do you know about timber? That's right, I'm talking about wood from any ordinary tree you might find along the roadside. Whether a criminal bumps into the bark, disturbs a pile of sawdust, or treads on some leaves, the chances are, they're always gonna leave a trace somehow. Add to that some knowledge of which trees grow in what areas, and if you're lucky, you can infer some crucial details. So, you know: trees. They're a sleuth's best friend.",,,Inazuma
3115,Shikanoin Heizou,About Kujou Sara,"Madam Kujou Sara? Yeah, that lady's gotta be the most serious person in the entire Tenryou Commission.

I just go wherever the evidence leads me.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kujou Sara,Inazuma
3116,Shikanoin Heizou,About Arataki Itto,"I've done a few favors before to deliver Roasted Lavender Melon to him in prison. This one time, I overheard him singing.

And it's not every day you come across an inmate who's in the mood to sing their heart out.",Friendship Lv. 4,Arataki Itto,Inazuma
3117,Shikanoin Heizou,About Kuki Shinobu,"The Arataki Gang is a free and diverse organization that accepts anyone, regardless of their background. Pretty amazing if you ask me.

3118,Shikanoin Heizou,About Yae Miko,"Come to think of it, Lady Guuji's publishing house also publishes murder mysteries, right? So... when can you introduce me? In this day and age, becoming a famous detective requires more than just ability — you need publicity, too. Huh? C'mon, I'm being serious here!",Friendship Lv. 4,Yae Miko,Inazuma
3119,Shikanoin Heizou,About Kaedehara Kazuha: Things in Common,"Oh, Kazuha? Yeah, he's a solid guy.

3120,Shikanoin Heizou,About Kaedehara Kazuha: Invitation,"Ohh... It's such a pity! Since the Vision Hunt Decree's been repealed, I no longer have any grounds to officially arrest him. But then again... I guess now, I can just openly invite him to come to the Tenryou Commission and discuss cases with me.",Friendship Lv. 4,Kaedehara Kazuha,Inazuma
3121,Shikanoin Heizou,About Gorou,"General Gorou's constant suspicion made my trip to Watatsumi Island much more eventful... Everywhere I went, there were soldiers keeping me under close surveillance. Honestly, I was a regular, boring tourist just like everybody else. So what if I happen to be a detective in my day job? I was clearly minding my own business there.",Friendship Lv. 4,Gorou,Inazuma
3122,Shikanoin Heizou,About Sangonomiya Kokomi,"I've actually never seen Madam Sangonomiya before. Whenever she appears, practically the whole village crowds around her... I'm not about to contend with that. Oh, and even if you made it through all the villagers, there'd still be a circle of shrine maidens around her! For one of us young people to gain that kind of recognition from everyone, it must have taken a lot of work.",Friendship Lv. 4,Sangonomiya Kokomi,Inazuma
3123,Shikanoin Heizou,About Kamisato Ayaka,I'm barely acquainted with the daughter of the Kamisato Clan. I'm glad that I'm not from some sort of prestigious family like that... it's definitely not the kind of life for me.,Friendship Lv. 4,Kamisato Ayaka,Inazuma
3124,Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: I,"Even when someone chooses to remain absolutely silent, you can still learn a lot about them just by observing their clothes, posture, and facial expressions. Now, if this conversation ended here... what could you gather from my appearance alone?",,,Inazuma
3125,Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: II,"Once, when I was sitting in on a criminal trial, I suddenly realized I'd cracked the case. So I interrupted the court just as they were about to declare the verdict. If my objection had turned out to be invalid, then that moment wouldn't have been the turning point that saw me become a detective. Instead, it would have been... ""Shikanoin Heizou, I hereby find you in contempt of court and order your immediate detention!"" Hahaha!",Friendship Lv. 3,,Inazuma
3126,Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: III,"Investigating extramarital affairs, tracking down runaway pets... Those are pretty much the only cases you'll find at a detective agency. I personally need cases of a higher caliber... so, obviously, my only option was to jump ship and join the Tenryou Commission. Another factor was that Sango and I didn't quite see eye to eye in a lot of areas... Just one of those things, I guess.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma
3127,Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: IV,"When I first joined the Tenryou Commission, I started honing my craft by reviewing some cold cases. Before I knew it, ""Mt. Coldcase"" had been completely leveled... It is a pity, these days I no longer have the time to go back and look through old files. I'm forever being brought in to help out on the toughest cases, and I barely have a moment to catch my breath between jobs... Well, what can you do. Once you're a detective of this caliber, the cases come to you.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Inazuma
3128,Shikanoin Heizou,More About Shikanoin Heizou: V,"By the time a detective is facing a criminal, they have in some sense already failed. Whatever you might do to establish the truth and identify the culprit, you'll never be able to undo the damage caused by the crime. That's why I want my reputation to spread. I want to be a famous detective that makes would-be criminals quake in their boots and quit while they're ahead! In other words, I want to nip crime in the bud.

You know, just pretend.",,,Inazuma
3130,Shikanoin Heizou,Shikanoin Heizou's Troubles,"There are always those people who resort to violence at the very last second, as if that'll somehow solve their problems. It's a real bummer.

The moment a detective has to use brute force, they've already lost.",,,Inazuma
3131,Shikanoin Heizou,Favorite Food,"Name me one item of food that doesn't taste better deep-fried. You can't, right? Whether it's meat or veggies, as long as it's been pulled out of the fryer, I'll love it! I don't think anyone with an empty stomach can resist the smell of fried food.",,,Inazuma

3263,Jean,About Rosaria,"Some may see Sister Rosaria as one who complains about how bothersome her work is, but she does her job well. Last time I saw her I told her she could come find me should she ever need help, to which she simply replied that doing so would be even more bothersome. I need to work harder to become of more assistance to the people of Mondstadt.",Friendship Lv. 4,Rosaria,Mondstadt

3267,Jean,About Eula,"Eula? Um... Please, do not hold her unfortunate background against her. The Knights of Favonius evaluate each person impartially. Eula has a clear sense of right and wrong and is more talented than most. The controversial statements that she makes from time to time are just a product of her personality.

3268,Jean,About Mika,"The Grand Master placed Mika on the front line of the expedition team not simply because he met the requirements of the mission — more importantly, he was impressed by Mika's hardworking and grounded nature.

3325,Yanfei,Good Evening,"The night market? Hmm... I was planning on organizing some files this evening, but if you're going, I can join you.

3327,Yanfei,About Yanfei: Atmosphere,"You think I come across as quite imposing when I'm reading through case files? Huh. Well, that's only when I'm in work mode. It's like...

3328,Yanfei,About Yanfei: Weakness,"Civil cases are the ones I dread the most. Divorces, custody disputes... It's a thankless task trying to unpack these kinds of cases with logic and reason. You have to be kind, courteous, and patient with your clients, even though half the time they are completely incapable of participating in a constructive discussion. *sigh* I know I advertise myself as being fully versed in every area of the law, but honestly, if it were up to me, I'd rather everyone could just get along, so we wouldn't have so many of these cases.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue

Not a bad deal, right?",,,Liyue
3330,Yanfei,About Us: Relationships,"If you're concerned about what kind of complicated issues you might get tied up in during your travels, your best bet is to bring someone with you who knows and understands the law. Someone like me, for example, whose expertise goes beyond just the law of Liyue... Well, actually, having said that, Fontaine's law is notoriously complicated... Though, with my level of intelligence, getting acquainted with it should be no problem! Anyway... My point is, you can always rely on me!",Friendship Lv. 6,,Liyue
3331,Yanfei,About the Vision,"Visions appear in response to strong desire, so as someone with ideals, it's only natural that I should have received one. Because, above all, I wish for all people to live honest lives and abide by the law. But some people will always insist on playing by their own rules and causing havoc for everyone else... Hah, those people can expect to be prosecuted so hard, they won't know what hit them!",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue
3332,Yanfei,Something to Share: Balance,"This steelyard balance was a gift from my father. It weighs objects to determine their value. I usually use Mora for the weight, but it can only give the original price. For example, a thousand years ago, Liyue was covered in Glaze Lilies, and they weren't worth anything in monetary terms. Then, when they suddenly declined in number, the price shot up in response, but the value shown by this steelyard wasn't updated. It still shows them as their original value... in other words, dirt cheap.So, most of the time, this isn't a very useful tool for work purposes... Hmm? You want to try weighing something? How about... We could weigh your little friend here, will that do?",Friendship Lv. 4,,Liyue

3334,Yanfei,Interesting Things,"The Historia Naturalis Liyue has an entry about a waterborne plant called the Horsetail. It claims that ""The Horsetail is a medicinal herb that stands alone on the banks of Dihua Marsh. Its color is that of the clouds at sunset."" Apparently, if you grind it into a powder and mix it into your ink, it makes your writing water-resistant. But it's a shame, I've been to Dihua Marsh at least a hundred times, and each time I end up with baskets and baskets of the common purple variety, but not a single one of the kind that the book describes.",,,Liyue
3335,Yanfei,About Qiqi,"I heard that little herb gatherer has written out a whole set of behavioral rules for herself. She may be small, but boy, has she got her head screwed on!

3336,Yanfei,About Ganyu,"Ganyu is kind and thoughtful, it's just a shame she's so busy all the time. Most of the time, she's buried in an endless pile of paperwork — the only exception being her nap at noon. Don't get me wrong, I have to put in some hours at work, too. But I'm happy with the job I've chosen, and it's certainly a lot less taxing than hers.",Friendship Lv. 4,Ganyu,Liyue
3337,Yanfei,About Xingqiu,"The Feiyun Commerce Guild is one of my oldest clients. Their approach to business is meticulous and thorough, and every business meeting I've had with them has always been attended by the head of the house himself.

3338,Yanfei,About Hu Tao,"I always hear people saying that the director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor has an unorthodox approach to business.

The Wangsheng Funeral Parlor provides a legitimate and necessary service, which is the cornerstone of any successful enterprise.

3339,Yanfei,About Zhongli,"Mr. Zhongli has so much in-depth knowledge on so many topics, he's like a walking library, you know what I mean? He's a total savant, though he never flaunts it. I could tell just by looking at him. People like him rarely shy away from taking on complex problems alone, so in my estimation he's certainly not a potential client.And yet, somehow, I can't help but think I know him from somewhere, it's hard to describe the feeling... I asked my father about it, and he just said something to the effect of he didn't know either, though he seemed a little evasive. It was so strange...

3340,Yanfei,About Ningguang,"You must have heard of the Tianquan, Ningguang? She's the highest authority where the law is concerned, and often makes amendments to the legal codices.

Why, the latest edition of the legal codices contained three new laws, 121 revised legal annotations, and an array of new legal precedents. Archons know how long it's going to take me to commit them to memory...Hmph... still, she's a businesswoman at heart, I'm not about to let her beat me when it comes to the law.

3341,Yanfei,About Keqing,"The Yuheng doesn't deal with matters of the law, and thank goodness... Knowing Keqing's attitude toward work and ruthless efficiency, I'd end up losing a lot of work. Although... No, surely it wouldn't come to that. She's a stickler for doing things the right way — no doubt she'd offend people... but if she had someone like me as her legal assistant... No way! Why should an eminent legal expert such as myself be relegated to the role of assistant!? If she needs legal counsel, she can come and find me.",Friendship Lv. 4,Keqing,Liyue
3342,Yanfei,About Eula,"Eula saved me once, and we've kept up correspondence ever since. She's very familiar with the Knights of Favonius' legislation, but has never been one to be bound by convention. She uses cunning logic to deal with problems flexibly... Perhaps the reason we get along so easily is that I'm a similar type myself. Still, I'll never acquire that carefree spirit of hers. We are in very different professions, after all.",Friendship Lv. 4,Eula,Liyue
3343,Yanfei,About Yelan,"Yelan is an employee of the Ministry of Civil Affairs — she once helped me crack a tough accounting fraud case. I treated her to dinner afterward. The only thing is...

3344,Yanfei,About Kuki Shinobu,"Shinobu? I remember her, she's the Inazuman girl that came to Liyue as an exchange student to specialize in law. When she was doing her coursework, she used to meet with me to discuss some cases, and after we were done, she'd always bow and thank me, which would always make me a little embarrassed. I always felt like she was going to make an excellent lawyer in the future. Thinking about it, Inazuma went into lockdown right around the time she would have graduated. I wonder how she's been doing since she went back...",Friendship Lv. 4,Kuki Shinobu,Liyue

3348,Yanfei,More About Yanfei: IV,"Sometimes, the commercial disputes I handle don't end very pleasantly.

Some people say I'm pretty terrifying, others try to avoid me altogether, but I don't need to explain myself to anyone. Since the very beginning, the welfare of Liyue has been my primary concern!Think about it — the origin of disputes can be traced back to the violation of contracts.

3382,Alhaitham,About Lesser Lord Kusanali,"One should neither dismiss nor overly revere the divine. Gods require followers, and they are also part of a biological hierarchy.

3423,Wriothesley,About the Vision,Some inmates once taught me a way to wield the elements by throwing around chemical potions. I guess whoever's in charge of handing out Visions doesn't care too much about a little rule-bending.,Friendship Lv. 4,,Fontaine

I can only assume that I had disturbed him in the middle of something.",Friendship Lv. 4,Neuvillette,Fontaine
3427,Wriothesley,About Furina,"Miss Furina displayed a severe lack of interest in my trial and excused herself early, probably because I pleaded guilty to all charges as soon as they were announced.

3430,Wriothesley,About Lyney,"I'll admit that when I removed the House of the Hearth's spies in the underworld, that was kind of an intentional provocation to the Fatui.

3431,Wriothesley,About Navia,"The Fortress of Meropide works with Spina di Rosula on some matters regarding supplies and logistics, but we don't have any other dealings.

3446,Wriothesley,Birthday,"Our tradition says that all children of Fontaine are born amid their parents' wishes and blessings, but I'd like to think that all children are born from such wonderful feelings.

3483,Mona,Mona's Hobbies,"My hobby? Stargazing! In this all-too-real world in which we live, we all need to look up from the dust once in a while and fix our gaze on the stars, in a spirit of wonder... That, plus the whole thing about me being an astrologer.",,,Mondstadt
3484,Mona,Mona's Troubles,"*sigh* The equipment repair bill is due, and so is the final payment for that celestial globe I ordered...

3521,Kaeya,About Fischl,"Hmm? You think Fischl having one eye covered is very fitting given her title of Prinzessin der Verurteilung. Hahaha, if that's the case, that must also make me a descendant of some kind of former royal lineage, no?",Friendship Lv. 4,Fischl,Mondstadt

3523,Kaeya,About Rosaria,"Ahaha, you want to know about the secrets of Sister Rosaria? That... I cannot tell you. Though my impression of her is not bad — certainly better than a certain someone whose name I won't bother to mention. She's honest with herself.

3524,Kaeya,About Sucrose,"Sucrose may not be much of an extrovert in public, but as they say — it's always the quiet ones...

But then again, no one else could do the job like me.",,,Inazuma
3558,Kuki Shinobu,About Kuki Shinobu: Backup Plan,"Hmm? What would happen if the gang ever disbanded? First of all, that would never happen. Secondly, even if that did happen, I've got nothing to worry about. I've always got a way to make ends meet.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Inazuma

3568,Kuki Shinobu,About Arataki Itto,"The boss has a lot of unpleasant memories from his past, but he still manages to stay positive. I'd say that kind of resilience is pretty rare. He treats us well and his character has a good effect on everyone in the gang. Of course, it's never an excuse for him to run amok with no consideration for others.

3569,Kuki Shinobu,About Yanfei,"Back then I had an argument with my family and I only wanted to run away as far as I could.

3570,Kuki Shinobu,About Shikanoin Heizou,"He's different from the other Doushin of the Tenryou Commission. I have yet to see him on patrol or apprehend anyone, and he occasionally comes to me to buy intelligence. In exchange, I asked him to put in a good word for me whenever I'm bailing people out of the Police Station. He gladly agreed. I'd say that's a pretty good deal...

3572,Kuki Shinobu,More About Kuki Shinobu: II,"I come from a family of shrine maidens but I'm not cut out for that kind of work at all. When I ran away from home, I immediately thought I should learn as much as possible to support myself.

3574,Kuki Shinobu,More About Kuki Shinobu: IV,"When I first joined the Arataki Gang, the boss told me to teach the others how to fight. So the first thing I did was beat them up, one by one. I was a little surprised that even in their bruised and swollen state they still respectfully called me Shinobu and asked me to lead them.

It can be pretty annoying having to clean up their mess all the time, but in return, they treat me with a sincerity that is irreplaceable... They always save the best things for me and never leave me feeling down. When I announced my decision to stay in the gang, they all cheered for me. I know outsiders don't think very highly of the Arataki Gang, and the members themselves don't really care what others think. But, I still want to strive to change the impression we leave. I might complain about them from time to time as my family, but I'll never let anyone badmouth them.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Inazuma
3576,Kuki Shinobu,Kuki Shinobu's Hobbies,"Being in the gang means having lots of free time. I often finish reading a whole book or even pass a certificate exam before I even realize it. Kinda nice, wouldn't you agree? When my family asks about me, at least I can tell them I don't waste my time, and when I go job hunting, I have lots of qualifications to rely on. In this ultra-competitive society, a misfit like myself with all these certificates will never go hungry.",,,Inazuma

3732,Sayu,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"I think I'm finally ready to go it alone now, just like sensei said I should. And... maybe it's not such a big deal now if I can't grow any taller. Because what really matters... is that I have you to keep me company.",Ascension Phase 6,,Inazuma
3733,Tartaglia,Hello,"I'm No. 11 of the Fatui Harbingers, codename Childe, but I also go by Tartaglia. And you... Hmm, you too like to cause quite the stir, don't you? Something tells me we're going to get along splendidly.",,,Snezhnaya
3734,Tartaglia,Chat: Idleness,"You know, there are better ways to seek out our enemies than... well, standing here.",,,Snezhnaya
3735,Tartaglia,Chat: Test of Skills,"This place is pretty dead... By which I mean, there's nothing to kill.",,,Snezhnaya
3736,Tartaglia,Chat: The Fatui,"I wonder what the rest of the Harbingers are up to? Plotting and scheming on an ever-grander scale, no doubt.",,,Snezhnaya
3737,Tartaglia,Chat: Snezhnaya,"Where I'm from, if we didn't keep moving, we'd freeze to death. Literally.",,,Snezhnaya

3739,Tartaglia,When It Snows: Foreign Country,"Haha, ahh... could it be snowing in Snezhnaya too?",,,Snezhnaya
3740,Tartaglia,When It Snows: Snezhnaya,"The world looks glorious in the snow. Pure white, like the light of the moon. A perfect backdrop for bloodshed.",,,Snezhnaya
3741,Tartaglia,When It's Windy,The wind is picking up. There is conflict in the air.,,,Snezhnaya
3742,Tartaglia,Wind Is Building Up: Foreign Country,Just look at that wind blow!,,,Snezhnaya
3743,Tartaglia,Wind Is Building Up: Snezhnaya,"The wind permeates all, cleansing both mind and body. Excellent.",,,Snezhnaya

3747,Tartaglia,Good Night,"Today was great. See you tomorrow, comrade!",,,Snezhnaya
3748,Tartaglia,About Tartaglia,A warrior must always be ready to face any challenge with his blade. The outcome of the battle is irrelevant — what matters is that you learn from the experience.,,,Snezhnaya
3749,Tartaglia,About Us: Comrades,"Ah, I'm sure the Harbingers must know of my dealings with you by now. Oh, I'd love to see the look on their faces... Hahaha...",,,Snezhnaya
3750,Tartaglia,About Us: Weapons,I am the least adept with a bow. And that is precisely why I must master it.,Friendship Lv. 6,,Snezhnaya
3751,Tartaglia,About Us: Survival,You wield such powers without owning a Vision... I really am excited to see what you have in store for us... Let's see how far you can go. Just don't go dying on me before you lay it all on the line in our own final battle! I won't allow it!,Friendship Lv. 6,,Snezhnaya
3752,Tartaglia,About Us: Invitation,"Comrade, how would you like to join the Fatui? ...Actually, scrap that. With your capabilities, you and I could head-to-head with the Harbingers and win. Wouldn't want to miss an opportunity like that.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Snezhnaya
3753,Tartaglia,About the Vision,"If it makes me stronger, I'll take it. Vision? Great. Delusion? Don't mind if I do. Heretical teachings from the Abyss? Sign me up.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Snezhnaya
3754,Tartaglia,Something to Share,The skeletal-white snowscape devours life without leaving any trace. It is the invisible enemy we fight against each day.,,,Snezhnaya
3755,Tartaglia,Interesting Things,"I once ventured deep into the abyss and came face-to-face with an enormous beast. I don't know its name, all I know is the sight of it chilled me to the bone. But mark my words, one day I will march back in there and behead that beast, and you, comrade, will be my witness!",,,Snezhnaya
3756,Tartaglia,About Skirk,"It's been years since I last saw my master. I should hope that next we meet, I'll at least be able to force her to use both hands to beat me...",Friendship Lv. 4,Skirk,Snezhnaya
3757,Tartaglia,About Zhongli: Pondering,"There's far more to that man than meets the eye. As for the extent of his power... lots to look forward to, I think.",Friendship Lv. 4,Zhongli,Snezhnaya
3758,Tartaglia,About Zhongli: Challenge,"Tell me, how has Mr. Zhongli been lately? Not bad, you say? Seems he's had no problem acclimating to ""mortal"" life. Hmph, he sure had me fooled. Such a fiasco mustn't be so easily forgiven! The only way to reconciliation is fierce combat! What do you mean I'm no match for him? Hahaha...",Friendship Lv. 4; A New Star Approaches,Zhongli,Snezhnaya
3759,Tartaglia,About Tsaritsa,"Her Royal Highness the Tsaritsa is actually a gentle soul. Too gentle, in fact, and that's why she had to harden herself. Likewise, she declared war against the whole world only because she dreams of peace. And because she made an enemy of the world, I had the chance to become acquainted with you.",Friendship Lv. 4,Tsaritsa,Snezhnaya
3760,Tartaglia,About Varka,"Varka? Just the thought of one day going head-to-head with him in combat, the fabled Knight of Boreas himself, titan of the Knights of Favonius... It makes me buzz with excitement. It's a beautiful life we live in this world.",Friendship Lv. 4,Varka,Snezhnaya
3761,Tartaglia,About The Jester,"He was the first ever Fatui Harbinger, and today he is our leader. He only appears on important occasions. As for his accomplishments... To be honest, I don't really care. I owe my loyalty and devotion to the Tsaritsa, no one else.",Friendship Lv. 4,Pierro,Snezhnaya
3762,Tartaglia,About The Captain,"I've seen him in battle before, and oh what a sight it was. Perhaps I'm ranked too low for him to notice me right now. Well, he may not recognize my strengths yet, but one day, I'll show him what I'm made of.",Friendship Lv. 4,Il Capitano,Snezhnaya
3763,Tartaglia,About The Doctor,"I heard that he took segments of himself at different ages, made prostheses out of them, and assigned different tasks to each one. I know... all my comrades are a little weird. Well, come to think of it, if I met another version of myself... Hah, we'd have to fight then and there to decide which one of us gets to survive.",Friendship Lv. 4,Il Dottore,Snezhnaya
3764,Tartaglia,About Damselette,"The Fatui Harbingers are ranked by strength, and I have no idea why that girl is No. 3. I'd test my skills with every Harbinger who ranks above me if I had the chance, but when it comes to her... something just doesn't feel right. Anyway, you should be careful around her.",Friendship Lv. 4,Columbina,Snezhnaya
3765,Tartaglia,About The Knave,"Look, I've got nothing against people who have their own agendas — I myself joined the Fatui to get more experience in combat. But I don't like her at all. If she stood to benefit from betraying others, she'd turn against the Tsaritsa in a heartbeat. There isn't a sane bone in her body.",Friendship Lv. 4,Arlecchino,Snezhnaya
3766,Tartaglia,About The Rooster,"I don't know what his motivations could be, but he seems genuine about wanting to help me. He treats me just like family. Oh, and speaking of family — Tonia and Teucer are always telling me about the pastries and other gifts he brings them when they write. So while I've been away from Snezhnaya, he's kept his promise to take care of my family.",Friendship Lv. 4,Pulcinella,Snezhnaya
3767,Tartaglia,About Marionette,"She always seems engrossed in her research. Hmm... I wonder if those machines have anything to do with her?

I have no idea what I possibly could have done to annoy her, though.",Friendship Lv. 4,Sandrone,Snezhnaya
3768,Tartaglia,About Regrator,"Oh, now that guy has a head full of grandiose plans fueled by raw ambition. I don't understand a word he says once he starts talking about his theories... Eh, but as long as he keeps our cash reserves stocked up, I'm not complaining.",Friendship Lv. 4,Pantalone,Snezhnaya
3769,Tartaglia,About The Fair Lady,"I never got along with her, you know that. I guess there's not much more worth saying about her at this point. When you're a harbinger, you have to accept that death could come at any time... But don't worry about me. No matter what happens, I'll do whatever it takes to keep myself alive.",Friendship Lv. 4; Omnipresence Over Mortals,,Snezhnaya
3770,Tartaglia,About The Balladeer,"After he took the Gnosis, we lost all contact with him. Now comes the task of trying to hunt it down and get it back...

3772,Tartaglia,More About Tartaglia: II,"Face me in person, man to man, and I'll always have a chance of beating you. Same goes if you're a deity or a monster from the abyss. But the Harbingers? They are more enamored with their intangible methods, spending their days scheming and maneuvering. This is why we cannot get along.",Friendship Lv. 3,,Snezhnaya
3773,Tartaglia,More About Tartaglia: III,"However far away my motherland may be, we all live under the same sky. That snow-white moon... My family must be able to see it too. I hope my siblings... *sigh* I hope that they have turned out to be formidable warriors as well.",Friendship Lv. 4,,Snezhnaya
3774,Tartaglia,More About Tartaglia: IV,"Comrade, a word of advice: Don't go yelling stupid things in the heat of battle. They might sound good in your head, but if you think about it, they make no sense at all. I'm talking about things like, ""I'm on fire!"" That's the last thing we want. Fire leaves behind nothing but ashes. And you must survive at all costs.",Friendship Lv. 5,,Snezhnaya
3775,Tartaglia,More About Tartaglia: V,"Ah, how time flies. One day, you will see how I conquer the world and crush the thrones of gods beneath my heel. In the meantime... no dying, comrade! Keep yourself alive! Hahaha.",Friendship Lv. 6,,Snezhnaya

3779,Tartaglia,Least Favorite Food,"Food is like weaponry. A true warrior never deliberates unduly over their choice of weapon, nor do they do so over the food they eat. Neither should you.",,,Snezhnaya
3780,Tartaglia,Receiving a Gift: I,"Eating delicious food really has a way of taking all your cares away. Now, how should I repay you?",,,Snezhnaya
3781,Tartaglia,Receiving a Gift: II,"Your cooking skills seem to have improved quite a lot. Does that mean you're getting stronger all the time, too?",,,Snezhnaya
3782,Tartaglia,Receiving a Gift: III,"Um, I'll admit the taste surprises me a little. Hmm? Okay... I'll try one more bite.",,,Snezhnaya
3783,Tartaglia,Birthday,"Happy birthday, comrade! Anyone you need knocked off their perch today? Let me know. I'll happily oblige...",,,Snezhnaya
3784,Tartaglia,Feelings About Ascension: Intro,"Hohoho, I feel like I've gotten stronger! Now, who shall I use as my guinea pig...",Ascension Phase 1,,Snezhnaya
3785,Tartaglia,Feelings About Ascension: Building Up,"""A warrior's strength is like a dome. The bigger the dome, the more opponents he can challenge inside it."" Hmm, who was it that said this again?",Ascension Phase 2,,Snezhnaya
3786,Tartaglia,Feelings About Ascension: Climax,"Bravo, comrade! Thanks to your help, I am one step closer to my goal of conquering the world. I doubt even the Tsaritsa herself ever expected I would make it this far.",Ascension Phase 4,,Snezhnaya
3787,Tartaglia,Feelings About Ascension: Conclusion,"Comrade. Make sure you keep training too. Otherwise, who will be left to fight me to the death when the world lies defeated at my feet? Hahaha.",Ascension Phase 6,,Snezhnaya
